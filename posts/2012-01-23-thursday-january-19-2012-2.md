Rode a minibus early in the morning to the Big Buddha pier on the north side of Ko Samui. Rode a ferry to the island Ko Phangan for about forty-five minutes. Rode a songthaew taxi truck for 100 baht to Baan Tai beach. There was some confusion about where to find my hostel, and I walked around in the searing heat for twenty minutes before slogging into the place to check in. Ate lunch at the little restaurant beside the hostel and the road. Changed into my swim suit and headed to the beach. Walked down the beach quite a ways to find a patch of soft sand and water without floating weed bits. Baan Tai beach wasn't as nice as Chaweng beach on Ko Samui. Felt a tinge of regret leaving it. Waded in, but didn't submerge my head. Mostly read Treasure Island on the sand. Returned to the beachside resort that was partnered with my hostel and swam a little in their pool and had a couple beers. Chatted with a German named Eric for a half hour. Walked to the night market with him and his friend David and another guy from my hostel later that evening for dinner. On the way back, we stopped at a bar and had a beer and played a few rounds of billiards. I taught them the game nine ball. Returned to the hostel and went to bed.
