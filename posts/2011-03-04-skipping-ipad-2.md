I awaited with great anticipation March 2, the day Apple revealed the iPad 2. I adore my iPad 1, and was intrigued by recent rumors about retina displays, cameras, hot spots, and A5s. Alas, I came away from reading about that day’s announcements feeling ho-hum.

It’s thinner, lighter, faster; it has an additional motion sensor; it has front and rear cameras; you can get it in ugly white as well as sexy black; and it has an eye-popping new type of case that uses magnets to attach.

You can see on the iPad 1’s front a hole for a camera that was never included. Since that initial disappointment, and being used to not capturing pictures and videos with it, and not having anyone to FaceTime with anyway, I haven’t really missed not having a camera.

The speed boost and slimmer hardware are expected. I’m sure iPad 3 will get the memory boost that iPad 2 needed.

I’m just not excited enough about iPad 2 to replace my iPad 1. The same thing happened with iPhone 3G: it wasn’t a compelling enough improvement to warrant replacing my first iPhone.

I’ll be skipping iPad 2, and looking forward to what will come in a year.
