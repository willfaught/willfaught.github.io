Ate another American breakfast and got a sandwich to go for lunch on the slow boat. Boarded at 8:30 a.m. and sat and waited for the stragglers to arrive. Departed around 9:30 a.m. Sat with Aimee (from Austin, Texas) and we chatted for a while. I also read and listened to a couple podcasts and some music. The scenery was again very beautiful. This time my seat was much more cramped, but still the time passed quickly enough. We arrived in Luang Prabang, the old capital of Laos (rhymes with cow, not mouse), and Aimee and I took a tuk tuk to our hostel, Spicylaos. Walked with Aimee, Shelley, Glenn, and Matteo to the night market and ate a cheap dinner on the street for 10,000 kip (remember, I'm a multi-millionaire here). We crossed over the ridge of Phou Si hill near the market as a shortcut to a popular bar and lounge we had heard about called Laos Laos Garden. We ordered buckets there and hung out for an hour or so. The group decided to go dancing or bowling, I can't recall which, and I headed for the toilet quickly before we left. I was gone for only a minute, but in that time everyone had piled into a tuk tuk and was gone. I found myself unexpectedly alone and decided to make my way back to the hostel and call it a night.
