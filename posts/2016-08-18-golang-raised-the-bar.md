title: "Golang raised the bar"
---
Golang raised the bar for new language distributions: \- UTF-8 code \- Testing, benchmarking, and profiling built in \- Single command line tool \- Build tool that leaves code directories clean \- Package manager \- Package doc browser \- Standard code style and formatter \- Fast builds \- Language spec with grammar and thorough library documentation \- Uniform, batteries-included standard library \- Concurrency support and automatic parallelism, sync and atomic libs, race detector \- Interfaces, not inheritance \- Vendoring support \- Cross compilation \- Static linking only for simple deployments \- Tabs, not spaces \- No semicolon line terminators \- Trailing commas in lists to minimize diffs \- Static types \- Default values for uninitialized variables \- Built-in comparisons and hashing \- Safety (e.g. bounds checking) \- Managed memory (uses GC, but could use ARC) \- Simple encapsulation model (package level only) \- Use of lower-vs-uppercase for meaning (exports in this case) \- Simple selective build inclusion with tags and file name suffixes \- Built-in code generation \- Packages buildable without make files, just code \- "Panic" program crashes for programmer errors \- No unused local variables or imports \- No build warnings or other output noise \- Qualified imports only (idiomatically) If it doesn't do these, it's already outmoded. Looking at you, Swift.
