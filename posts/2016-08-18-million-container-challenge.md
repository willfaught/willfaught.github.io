title: "Million container challenge"
---
From https://www.hashicorp.com/c1m.html:

>Cluster schedulers promise us ease of deployment with ultimate scalability. We designed an ambitious challenge to test these promises: schedule one million containers. We call this the Million Container Challenge (C1M).
>
>HashiCorp prides itself on creating technically excellent software, and the C1M is a test to showcase this. We tested Nomad against the C1M to ensure that we meet the needs of our users at any scale.
>
>A cluster of five Nomad servers scheduled one million containers in less than five minutes, a rate of 3,750 containers per second. Details and observations of this benchmark are explained below.

Sounds really impressive.
