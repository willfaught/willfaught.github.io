From https://blog.prototypr.io/macos-it-s-time-to-take-the-next-step-ee7871ccd3c7#.my414arfi:


Andrew Ambrosino hits the nail on the head:

>With the release of macOS should come innovation that positions the OS for the next decade of innovation, and it’s all about common threads that run through the ecosystem. Specifically, macOS 11 should introduce a common framework for presentation, a brand new model for content, and a common thread for people.

>[...]

>When these three new developments materialize– UIKit, a new Filesystem, and a new model for people– there will be an explosion in next-generation apps across the ecosystem. This ecosystem, now drawn tightly together, will be a collection of four purpose-built operating system variants built on one common, advanced platform, one best described as Apple OS.

I've been waiting for them to do this for a long time. It's so obvious.

Great screen shot mockups too.
