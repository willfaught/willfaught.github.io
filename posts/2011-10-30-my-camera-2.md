[ch3n](http://ch3n.tumblr.com/) asked me which camera I used to take pictures in South Korea. The camera that I've used for the last half year is the [Canon PowerShot S95](http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-S95-Stabilized-3-0-Inch/dp/B003ZSHNGS). It's a remarkable camera that takes stellar pictures. I've been complimented on how great my pictures look, but my secret is this magical device. I highly recommend it. I've met two other people on my journey that had one and they loved theirs just as much.
