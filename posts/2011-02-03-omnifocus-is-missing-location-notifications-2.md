title: "OmniFocus is missing location notifications"
---


OmniFocus for iPhone is a pretty great task organizer. You can even view a map of your surrounding area to see which tasks you can accomplish near your location. What confuses me is why they haven't added what seems to me to be an obvious extension of this: location-based notifications. When I'm in the neighborhood of a QFC, I'd like my iPhone to notify me that I can get an errand done. I looked a little at the Apple web site, and I think there's a way to do this. That OmniGroup hasn't added it boggles my mind. It would easily double the value of the app. OmniFocus costs $20, and without location notifications, it's way overpriced.
