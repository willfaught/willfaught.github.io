If you're going to advertise an apartment for rent, be sure to: * Provide an email address. I don't want to wait until you're awake or not eating dinner to contact you. * Show large pictures of the interior, including the bedrooms and bathrooms. * Mention if there are fewer dedicated parking spaces than there are bedrooms. * Mention if there is no microwave.
