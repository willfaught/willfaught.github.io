Ate breakfast at the hostel. Jake drove me in a tuk tuk to Angkor Wat, Banteay Kdei, Ta Prohm, The Bayon in Angkor Thom, and Phnom Bakheng, to the top of which I hiked for a sunset view. Needless to say, the temples there are exquisite and exciting to explore. My favorite was Angkor Wat, but The Bayon was a close second. I ate dinner at the same street place as the day before. I arranged to have Jake drive me around the next day as well.
