title: "Symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression"
---
During the past several years, I experienced a variety of symptoms caused by stress, anxiety, and depression caused by my academic studies and thesis. **Physical symptoms:** * Blurred vision * Heart palpitations * Chest pain * Numbness * Twitches * Teeth grinding * Ear pain ([temporomandibular joint disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint_disorder)) * Weight loss * Dizziness * Exhaustion * Panic attacks **Mental symptoms:** * Insomnia * Irritability * Moodiness * Agitation * Loneliness * Detachment * Introversion * Impaired memory * Impaired focus * Impaired cognition * Bad judgment **Behavioral symptoms:** * Procrastination * Nervous habits * Excessive sleeping There are others that I won't mention. God help you if this ever happens to you, because the symptoms are numerous, often subtle, and can be construed as symptoms of other, more serious problems (like multiple sclerosis). MRIs of my head and neck and a visit to a neurologist gave me a clean bill of health. I would not wish this upon anyone.
