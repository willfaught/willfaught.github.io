Casey Liss on the Apple Watch:

>The Apple Watch strikes me as the next great frontier. In much the same way putting a computer with a built-in GPS in our pocket opened whole new doors, I suspect the Apple Watch will eventually do the same. I see that this is the future. I don’t doubt it.

>I’m unconvinced.

After trying a few on and using one a couple times, I find myself thinking the same thing. I can see the potential, but it's just not quite there yet. For a company that is known for successfully swooping into a new market at exactly the right time, this is an unexpected blunder. I think we all expected to be more blown away by the Watch, but everyone seems to be struggling to justify the price.

I'll probably wait for a later model. Most assuredly the second version will be much improved, as it goes with most new Apple products. What would get me to take a second look is severing the iPhone tether, LTE, GPS, native apps, more watch faces that are all equally customizable, improved wrist raising and lowering interactions, more responsive touch controls, a less confusing UI, a slimmer shape, more wrist band colors, and better battery life.
