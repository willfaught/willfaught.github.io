The name of the current big iPad suggests that the name of the new small iPad, rumored to be unveiled tomorrow, will be just iPad, not iPad Nano, iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Junior. If Apple had named "the new iPad" iPad 3, then the new small iPad would have to be named something like iPad Something, iPad 3 Something, or iPad 4 to differentiate it; but they didn't. What seems more probable is that Apple will adopt the naming convention of some of their other products, namely iPod, iMac, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro, in which a family of related products all share the same name and are differentiated by a simple yet obvious characteristic like storage capacity or screen size: iPod touch 32/64 GB, iMac 24/27", MacBook Air 11/13", and MacBook Pro 13/15".

I predict the names of the big and small iPads will henceforth be iPad, 7" or 9" (or 8" and 10" if you round).
