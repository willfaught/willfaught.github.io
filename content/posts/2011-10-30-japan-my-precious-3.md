**Tokyo**

I went to [Harajuku](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Harajuku&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&biw=1366&bih=690&sei=%20GmitTsGtHPD2mAXr4qzlDg), the young fashion center of Tokyo, to see the bizarre outfits and explore the clothing shops. I ate [udon](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=udon&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&biw=1366&bih=690&sei=%20PGitTojGJo7mmAWbo52GDw) for the first time for lunch.

I went to the Apple store in Shibuya and bought a [128 GB 11" MacBook Air](http://www.apple.com/macbookair/). I couldn't stand not having my own computer environment anymore. I had been having trouble finding the time or opportunity to blog about my experiences. I needed a way to back up my pictures in case I lost my camera. I wanted to upgrade my iPhone's operating system to version 5, which unfortunately had  been released *after* I left home. I knew exactly what I wanted, and the staff there were great getting me all set up. Thanks to the great service [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/), my entire digital environment is accessible worldwide: music, documents, pictures, videos, anything I want accessible. I just have to wait for it all to download. From this point on, everything I blogged was done with my new precious.

With my new laptop secure in my daypack, I rode the subway to [Shinjuku](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Shinjuku&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&biw=1366&bih=690&sei=%20HmqtTre3PKHRmAXN5aHbDg) and explored the high-rise government buildings and brightly-signed streets of the [Kabukicho](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Shinjuku&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&biw=1366&bih=690&sei=%20HmqtTre3PKHRmAXN5aHbDg#um=1&hl=en&client=safari&rls=en&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=Kabukicho&pbx=1&oq=Kabukicho&aq=f&aqi=g10&aql=1&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=46007l46007l0l46320l1l1l0l0l0l0l88l88l1l1l0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&fp=fadb8163ed6756c3&biw=1366&bih=690) red light district.

From there, I rode the subway to [Ikebukuro](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Ikebukuro&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&biw=1366&bih=690&sei=%20pWqtTqjgG-TDmQWgos2fBQ) and sought out [Sunshine City](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Ikebukuro&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&biw=1366&bih=690&sei=%20pWqtTqjgG-TDmQWgos2fBQ#um=1&hl=en&client=safari&rls=en&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=Ikebukuro+sunshine+city&pbx=1&oq=Ikebukuro+sunshine+city&aq=f&aqi=g-S3&aql=1&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=11913l13497l0l13817l14l14l0l10l10l0l179l485l2.2l4l0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&fp=fadb8163ed6756c3&biw=1366&bih=690). After an hour of searching, my feet were tired, and my throat felt sore, so I gave up and returned home.

Just before bed, I researched some elements of Japanese culture that I wanted to experience, like a [Japanese tea ceremony](http://www.google.com/search?pq=japan+puppet&hl=en&sugexp=kjrmc&cp=4&gs_id=k&xhr=t&q=bunraku&qe=YnVucg&qesig=5t4igWj5FnVfgoqDW9n7jg&pkc=AFgZ2tlbmvbSjeMdEpp08g3WBVeiOlJaNEx7TLtjBcrJT6HSzf0w6yEPxhbmO6I1R298OkmqGf3TUol8L5P3Bw_VL7O4skuMxA&client=safari&rls=en&gs_sm=&gs_upl=&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&biw=1366&bih=690&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi#um=1&hl=en&client=safari&rls=en&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=japanese+tea+ceremony&oq=japanese+tea+cere&aq=0&aqi=g10&aql=1&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=14226l16759l0l17462l17l15l0l4l4l1l205l1622l3.7.1l11l0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&fp=fadb8163ed6756c3&biw=1366&bih=690), [kabuki theater](http://www.google.com/search?pq=japan+puppet&hl=en&sugexp=kjrmc&cp=4&gs_id=k&xhr=t&q=bunraku&qe=YnVucg&qesig=5t4igWj5FnVfgoqDW9n7jg&pkc=AFgZ2tlbmvbSjeMdEpp08g3WBVeiOlJaNEx7TLtjBcrJT6HSzf0w6yEPxhbmO6I1R298OkmqGf3TUol8L5P3Bw_VL7O4skuMxA&client=safari&rls=en&gs_sm=&gs_upl=&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&biw=1366&bih=690&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi#um=1&hl=en&client=safari&rls=en&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=kabuki&pbx=1&oq=kabuki&aq=f&aqi=g10&aql=1&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=16700l17589l0l17867l6l6l0l1l1l0l188l811l0.5l5l0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&fp=fadb8163ed6756c3&biw=1366&bih=690), [bunraku puppetry](http://www.google.com/search?pq=japan+puppet&hl=en&sugexp=kjrmc&cp=4&gs_id=k&xhr=t&q=bunraku&qe=YnVucg&qesig=5t4igWj5FnVfgoqDW9n7jg&pkc=AFgZ2tlbmvbSjeMdEpp08g3WBVeiOlJaNEx7TLtjBcrJT6HSzf0w6yEPxhbmO6I1R298OkmqGf3TUol8L5P3Bw_VL7O4skuMxA&client=safari&rls=en&gs_sm=&gs_upl=&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&biw=1366&bih=690&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi), and [sumo wrestling](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=sumo+wrestling&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&biw=1366&bih=690&sei=%20V2utTprWO8WAmQXp0oTQDg).
