<p>I awaited with great anticipation March 2, the day Apple revealed the iPad 2. I adore my iPad 1, and was intrigued by recent rumors about retina displays, cameras, hot spots, and A5s. Alas, I came away from reading about that day&#8217;s announcements feeling ho-hum.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s thinner, lighter, faster; it has an additional motion sensor; it has front and rear cameras; you can get it in ugly white as well as sexy black; and it has an eye-popping new type of case that uses magnets to attach.</p>

<p>You can see on the iPad 1&#8217;s front a hole for a camera that was never included. Since that initial disappointment, and being used to not capturing pictures and videos with it, and not having anyone to FaceTime with anyway, I haven&#8217;t really missed not having a camera.</p>

<p>The speed boost and slimmer hardware are expected. I&#8217;m sure iPad 3 will get the memory boost that iPad 2 needed.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m just not excited enough about iPad 2 to replace my iPad 1. The same thing happened with iPhone 3G: it wasn&#8217;t a compelling enough improvement to warrant replacing my first iPhone.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be skipping iPad 2, and looking forward to what will come in a year.</p>
