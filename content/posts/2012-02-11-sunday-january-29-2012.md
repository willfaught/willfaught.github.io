Bought some lunch to go and put it in my day pack. Rode a long tail boat from Krabi to Railay East. Climbed to the vista point overlooking the Railay area. Ate my lunch while admiring the view. Tried to hike to a nearby lagoon, but it was too muddy. Walked to Railay West and went for a quick dip in the ocean and then laid on the sand and read for an hour or so. Got up and walked along the entire beach. It was even more beautiful at the other end. Storm clouds were gathering, so I arranged a long tail boat back to Krabi. It started raining heavily and ocean grew choppy, and I grew concerned about my camera and phone in my day pack; but everything stayed dry and we made it back in one piece. I arranged a minibus from my hostel to the Ko Phuket airport the following day to fly to Chiang Mai.
