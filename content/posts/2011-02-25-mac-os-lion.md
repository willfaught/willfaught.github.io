<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/">Mac OS Lion</a> looks promising:</p>&#13;
<ul><li>Choose and organize apps like iOS</li>&#13;
<li>Full screen apps</li>&#13;
<li>Better way to see running apps</li>&#13;
<li>File changes are saved automatically</li>&#13;
<li>File versions are stored and accessible like Time Machine</li>&#13;
<li>Restarting saves the state of running apps and restores them automatically</li>&#13;
<li>Easy file sharing with any Mac on your network</li>&#13;
<li>Server with wiki</li>&#13;
</ul><p>These are substantial new features that I would love to have. This is the kind of innovation I admire.</p>
