Damn you, Steam, for making me give you money! Today I bought: \- VVVVVV, $1.24 \- To The Moon, $3.49 \- Don't Starve, $3.74 \- La-Mulana, $2.99 \- Dust: An Elysian Tail, $2.99 \- Kairo, $0.99 \- Company of Heroes 2, $9.99 \- Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, $7.49 \- Dead Island Collection, $7.49 \- The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, $11.99 \- A Story About My Uncle, $3.24 So many indie, downloadable, and new games I hadn't heard of before. When will I ever have time to play all of these?
