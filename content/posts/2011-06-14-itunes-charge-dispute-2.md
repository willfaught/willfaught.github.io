iTunes just charged me $6 because I presumably elected to subscribe to The New Yorker magazine. (I didn't.) iTunes says all charges are final, and provides no obvious way to dispute charges or request refunds. So I'll dispute the credit card charge as soon as it appears on my statement. Let's see how iTunes wriggles its way out of that one.

What does iTunes do if you abuse credit card disputes and just dispute everything you buy? Do they deactivate your account if you dispute even a single charge (and hence break their precious purchase policy)?
