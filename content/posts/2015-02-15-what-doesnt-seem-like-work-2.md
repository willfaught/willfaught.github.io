title: "What Doesn't Seem Like Work?"
---
From http://www.paulgraham.com/work.html:

Paul Graham on knowing what you want to do:

>Few people know so early or so certainly what they want to work on. [...] If something that seems like work to other people doesn't seem like work to you, that's something you're well suited for.

And:

>The stranger your tastes seem to other people, the stronger evidence they probably are of what you should do.
