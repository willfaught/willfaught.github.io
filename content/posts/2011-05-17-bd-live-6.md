I've had a Blu-ray player for a couple years now, and I've yet to see BD-Live content I like. Usually, it's just ads for other movies. One time I saw a small ad in the corner of a Blu-ray interface for a movie ad in the BD-Live content. Somehow the movie studios have found yet another way to market to us, and have convinced us to pay for the privilege.
