title: "Social surgery"

I have Facebook and Twitter configured to copy everything I publish on my blog. Occasionally, I want to edit a post, but it's already been copied, so I have to edit the same content in multiple places. The phrase "social surgery" popped into my head, and I thought I was very clever for thinking it up, but it turns out that [I was beaten to it](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls;=en&q;=social+surgery&ie;=UTF-8&oe;=UTF-8).
