I watched *Inside Job* a few weeks ago. The visuals used to explain collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps were excellent. I actually hadn't understood what credit default swaps were until I watched this movie. I thought the interviews of Satyajit Pas and Eliot Spitzer were wonderfully insightful. Be sure to watch their extra scenes, which alone are worth renting the movie. It was refreshing to get the Icelandic narrative and perspective of the financial disaster. Actually, I'd say the weakest part of the movie is the narration of the U.S. story. I highly recommend watching it.
