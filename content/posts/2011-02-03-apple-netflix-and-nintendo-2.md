<p>It's kinda crazy how high Apple's stock is right now (currently $339). I wish I had invested more in it when it was only $90. I only considered buying their stock at the time because I believed in what they were doing, and didn't really care about dividends or stock price fluctuations.</p>&#13;
<p>I recently took stock of what I spend my money on and realized that Netflix is another company that I believe in, and would consider investing in without doing any research. For a while, I was using Netflix almost every day to stream video to my Apple TV, and I was getting three discs at a time. Netflix has gone on record stating that they consider themselves a streaming company now more than a movie rental company. Personally, I hate watching ads or paying outrageous prices per episode, so it's a great fit for me. I haven't even had live TV (cable or satellite) for over two years now.</p>&#13;
<p>Nintendo is another company I'd invest in without question. They have their failings, but they can make stellar games, and they're the only company that sells video game consoles at a profit from day one. The Wii and DS were hits, and I think 3DS will continue that success. Does Nintendo even trade on an American stock market, or do you have to go through a Japanese one? If I weren't so wrapped up right now, I'd look into it.</p>
