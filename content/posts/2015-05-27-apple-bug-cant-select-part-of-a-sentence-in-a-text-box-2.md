<p>I typed this into the Tumblr app:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;p&gt;So many great points and examples. This struck a chord.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t select just &ldquo;So many great points and examples. This struck a chord.&rdquo; If I tried, it selected the whole paragraph. But leaving the ending period out of the selection works. No kind of cursor or selection boundary fiddling worked.</p>
