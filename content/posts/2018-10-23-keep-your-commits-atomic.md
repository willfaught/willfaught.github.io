From https://www.freshconsulting.com/atomic-commits/:

Sean Patterson:

>- Commit each fix or task as a separate change
>- Only commit when a block of work is complete
>- Commit each layout change separately
>- Joint commit for layout file, code behind file, and additional resources

Invaluable advice for keeping a sane commit history.
