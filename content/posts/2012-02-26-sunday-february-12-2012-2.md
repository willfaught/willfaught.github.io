Rode a minibus to Phonsavan for six hours. Stopped at a small town on the way for lunch and ate with another guy from the minibus named Vincent. Shared a tuk tuk with Vincent and two girls from the Phonsavan bus terminal to the center of town where all the guesthouses are. Vincent and I shared a room with two twin beds. It was cheap, but the wifi sucked. We looked around at a couple of tourist agencies and all four of us finally booked a tour of the three Plain of Jars sites for the next day. I ended up deciding to ride a sleeper bus the next evening to Vang Vieng. We ate dinner at a local place about a block away, then went to bed.
