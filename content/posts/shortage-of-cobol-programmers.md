Ha, yes, it's been that way for a while: COBOL programmers are paid quite well because large dinosaur organizations (banks, schools, governments) still use systems that require it, but there aren't a lot of people left who know how to do the work. At some point in the past, some vendor convinced these organizations that it was worth the long-term investment to buy these really expensive systems. It turns out that technology evolves pretty quickly (who knew?!), so these systems were left in the dust. Now these organizations are trying to build modern systems on top of this creaky technology, and it's just terrible. This is why government websites are so bad. I just applied for unemployment, and the website said it would be unavailable after 10 PM every night. Can you imagine Facebook or Twitter being unavailable, ever? That crap doesn't fly in the real world. Rather than admit their mistake and swallow the cost of these bad products, the organizations try to make it work as long as possible, never mind the downsides.

"Literally, we have systems that are 40-plus-years-old," New Jersey Gov. Murphy said over the weekend. "There'll be lots of postmortems and one of them on our list will be how did we get here where we literally needed COBOL programmers?"

There won't be any post-mortems. The situation was already well understood, as I laid it out above. It's purely a political problem. Of course the engineers working with these systems have been asking for better replacements for decades. The governments could have bought better systems, but that would have required raising taxes or finding the money from somewhere, so they didn't do it. The fault lies squarely at the feet of the legislature. Every representative that came and went since those systems exhibited problems. It's as simple as that.

The reality is that it's not that hard to learn COBOL and get up to speed on working with it. That's true for any technology. I learn new programming stuff almost every day. Just because a programming language is old, that doesn't mean that it's necessarily bad. Lisp is one of the oldest languages around (1958, one year older than COBOL) and it's still one of the best. The reality is probably that these governments aren't willing to pay fair market wages and give engineers time to learn and train properly. They want someone who can walk in the door and be productive today, but for a fraction of what they're worth.

Gotta love those 1950s/1960s uppercase naming conventions!
