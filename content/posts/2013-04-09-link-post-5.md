I was delighted to find a short story by Jorge Luis Borges that I hadn't read before. I love his writings, and if you're a software engineer, I bet you'd like them too: >He divided the universe into forty categories or genera, these being further subdivided into differences, which were subdivided into species. He assigned to each genus a monosyllable of two letters; to each difference, a consonant; to each species, a vowel. For example: de, which means an element; deb, the first of the elements, fire; deba, a part of the element fire, a flame. In a similar language invented by Letellier (1850) a means animal; ab, mammal; abo, carnivore; aboj, feline; aboje, cat; abi, herbivore; abiv, horse; etc. In the language of Bonifacio Sotos Ochando (1845) imaba means building; imaca, harem; imafe, hospital; imafo, pesthouse; imari, house; imaru, country house; imedo, post; imede, pillar; imego, floor; imela, ceiling; imogo, window; bire, bookbinder; birer, bookbinding. If you liked this, check out [*Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tlön,_Uqbar,_Orbis_Tertius).
