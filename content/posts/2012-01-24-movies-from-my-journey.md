When I travel to places that remind me of movies that I've seen, I feel an urge to watch them again, like George Costanza was with food. So far, I've only watched Lost in Translation. But being in the south of Thailand among the tropical islands, I now plan to also watch again The Beach and The Man with the Golden Gun. Watch along with me!
