Andrew McDermott: >A tech employee, who I’ll call Alan, was watching anime porn at work. Not satisfied with simply watching it, he decided it was time to start printing his porn — on a color laser printer, no less. > >He printed it on transparencies which, as it turns out, weren’t compatible with the laser printer. > >They melted inside the printer. > >Alan has just ruined a very expensive new printer. Then to make matters worse, he takes the printer apart in a misguided attempt to try and fix things himself. He’s voided the warranty. > >After he was told specifically not to. > >Naturally, He Was Fired for His Mistake > >But it wasn’t for any of the mistakes I just mentioned. He definitely made a mess of things; he creeped out his co-workers, destroyed company property and cost his employers a lot of money. > >He was fired because he lied about it. It's a pretty good list.
