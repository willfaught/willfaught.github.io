title: "Why Some Diversity Thinkers Aren't Buying Tech Industry's 'Pipeline' Excuses"
---
From http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/07/19/486511816/why-some-diversity-thinkers-arent-buying-the-tech-industrys-excuses?sc=17&f=1019&utm_source=iosnewsapp&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=app:

“Diversity thinkers”? Who comes up with that terminology?

The pipeline _is_ a valid argument because [that's _exactly_ what’s happening](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding).

Anyone who disagrees ought to first take a look in the mirror: have you ever bought your kid a gender-specific toy? A doll for a girl? An action figure for a boy? Because if so, that’s the problem right there. The problem is you. The problem is social. The problem is parents holding their girls back by only giving them “girly” things.
