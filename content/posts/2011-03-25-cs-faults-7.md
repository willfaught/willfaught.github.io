A few nights ago while lying in bed I put together a list of things that I don't like about C:

* Side effects
* Weak typing
* Breakable semantics
* Simple types
* Design tends to put many cases into one struct
* No first-class functions
* No overflow/sign checks
* No homoiconicity or metacircular evaluation
* Weak macros
* Numerous code styles and conventions
* No namespaces
* Memory management
* Incorrect arithmetic
* Compiler-driven development
* Implementation-defined behavior
* No inherent or safe concurrency
* Multiple character sets
* Eager evaluation
* Encourages monolithic design
* Separate declarations and definitions
* No cheap container types like lists or tuples built in
* Difficult to reason about
* Debugging is necessary and primitive
* Declaration order matters

I began to think about what I would change to improve it while keeping it attractive to current users. Despite this list, I gained a newfound respect for C's design. It really is quite elegant for being so low level.
