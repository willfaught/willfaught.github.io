While looking into Docker I discovered CoreOS. This also looks very interesting: >- CoreOS is designed to be a modern, minimal base to build your platform. Allows for very quick PXE/iPXE booting. >- Utilizes an active/passive dual-partition scheme to update the OS as a single unit instead of package by package. This makes each update quick, reliable and able to be easily rolled back. >- Applications on CoreOS run as Docker containers. Containers provide maximum flexibility in packaging and can start in milliseconds. >- CoreOS works well on a single machine, but it's designed to be clustered. Easily run application containers across multiple machines with fleet and connect them together with service discovery. >- Built-in primitives such as distributed locking and master election are the building blocks for large scale distributed systems. >- Easily locate where services are being run within the cluster and be notified when something changes. Essential for a complex, highly dynamic cluster. Built into CoreOS with high availability and automatic fail-over.
