I forgot to say what my planned travel itinerary is:

* South Korea
* Japan
* Taiwan
* Hong Kong
* Vietnam
* Laos
* Cambodia
* Thailand
* Malaysia
* Singapore
* Indonesia
* Philippines
* India

Basically, most of East, Southeast, and South Asia.

I haven't done any research for any of these countries (except South Korea, where I am now), so I don't know which particular cities I'll go to, although I assume I'll at least visit the capital cities. I plan to buy a guidebook or read [WikiTravel](http://wikitravel.org/en/Main_Page) for each country just before or when I arrive there.

Depending on when I get tired of travel or run out of money, or if my interests change, I may not make it to all of them. I'm keeping my schedule flexible by buying flights as I go, although I have to have onward/return tickets before entering a lot of countries, which means I have to know my exit date ahead of time, which is annoying.

I plan to visit these countries in this order. I've heard there are problems along the Thailand-Cambodia border, and that it might be better to just fly to Thailand from another Southeast Asia country, or vice versa. Any information would be greatly appreciated!
