title: "CBS spills the beans on the new Apple streaming service"

> At Re/Code’s “Code” conference on May 27, CBS CEO Les Moonves acknowledged CBS has held talks with Apple and that they would “probably” sign a deal to carry the network on Apple’s expected streaming service.

Apple must be livid. No one has officially confirmed their rumored new service, and you can be damned sure Apple wanted it to be them. Steve Jobs is rolling in his grave.
