Here are my pictures from South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore:

* [South Korea](https://www.dropbox.com/gallery/18866064/1/South%20Korea%202011?h=9a5f74)
* [Japan](https://www.dropbox.com/gallery/18866064/1/Japan%202011?h=6116ec)
* [Hong Kong](https://www.dropbox.com/gallery/18866064/1/Hong%20Kong%202011?h=ed2cbc)
* [Singapore](https://www.dropbox.com/gallery/18866064/1/Singapore%202011?h=4eca07)

I tried using Flickr and Facebook to share them, but both failed me. Uploading to Flickr was too slow in Vietnam. Uploading to Facebook with iPhoto produced duplicates and limited albums to 200 pictures.

Dropbox came to my rescue. I exported 1,232 pictures from iPhoto to the Dropbox Photos directory with medium size and quality, weighing in at 83.8 MB. Simple and fast. I love it. Dropbox is definitely the way to go when you want to share lots of pictures. The only downside is that the pictures don't tie into Flickr or Facebook.
