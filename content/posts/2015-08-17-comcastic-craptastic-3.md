I'm on hold with Comcast, waiting for someone to help me. This loud, high-pitched saxophone jazz music is playing in the background, and every 60 seconds they play a loud ad about voting for my home town for some contest.

What were these people thinking? Why can't there just be a low beep every minute to let me know I'm still connected, and otherwise let me wait in peace and quiet? It's not enough that their customer support is terrible, they also have to subject me to this crap when I want to *add* more service (and they know this based on my phone input).

This is what happens when there's no market competition.
