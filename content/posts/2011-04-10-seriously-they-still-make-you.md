From http://www.baldessarini.com/:

It's been a while since I've run across a full-blown Flash web site. I ran across this one while shopping. This one has got to take the cake for gratuitous, gaudy presentation. Not only is it showy, but it's slower because of it. Someone needs to bring them out of the late '90s.
