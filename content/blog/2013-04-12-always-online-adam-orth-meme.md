title: Always Online Adam Orth meme
---

From http://www.quickmeme.com/Always-Online-Adam-Orth/:

Adam Orth resigned from Microsoft soon after [the public relations shit storm he created](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/04/adam-always-online-orth-no-longer-employed-at-microsoft/). Here are some hilarious parodies that are part of a meme about him and his remarks.

My favorite:

>I'm only an idiot when I'm online.

>And I'm always online.

I feel bad for the guy. His remarks were obviously taken out of context. He shouldn't have lost his job over this.
