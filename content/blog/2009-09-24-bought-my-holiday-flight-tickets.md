I figured that it would be cheaper to fly from the SEA airport in Seattle to SFO in San Francisco than to SMF in Sacramento, since there would probably be more flights on that route. I just checked and found to my surprise that SFO tickets are significantly more expensive. Maybe there's more demand? Interesting.

I wish one of these flight booking web sites would create a feature that would find the best ticket deal for me for a given holiday. I could just say, "I want to fly from Seattle to Sacramento for Christmas and be there about a week," and it would alert me when it found the best deal. Super sweet. [Bing](https://bing.com) has some new tools that help you figure that stuff out yourself, but it doesn't do it for you.

I just bought tickets for my flights home for Thanksgiving and Christmas. For the first time, I bought tickets directly from the airline instead of through sites like Priceline or Travelocity. The last time I bought through one of those sites I got sick just before the flight and had to eat the cost because the tickets were non-refundable. Never again.
