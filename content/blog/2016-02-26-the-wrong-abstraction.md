title: "The Wrong Abstraction"

From http://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction:

Great tip from Sandi Metz on how abstractions can worsen code:

>When the abstraction is wrong, the fastest way forward is back. This is not retreat, it's advance in a better direction. Do it. You'll improve your own life, and the lives of all who follow.
