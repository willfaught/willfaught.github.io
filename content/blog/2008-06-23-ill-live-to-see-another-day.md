title: I'll Live To See Another Day
---

The SLO heat wave has thankfully faded away. I think it's safe to remove my lemonade IV drip now. I don't think I could have taken another day of 100+ degree heat. It's terrible when it's so hot you sweat without even moving. I envy Hawaiians, you can get away with walking around in your swim suit in public all day long without drawing strange looks. I've always favored hot weather over cold, but I guess it's true that it's easier to overcome cold than heat. Fans are the greatest invention ever. I tried our AC, but apparently it just blows regular air. It's cool at night again now. I never thought I'd welcome the cold nights here. Unsurprisingly, the coldest place I could find in SLO was the grad lab. It was about a thirty-degree difference between the lab and outside. Talk about heaven!

My house mates got back into town today from a week-long camping trip. It sounded like fun; I wish I could go camping too. It's been so long since I've done the real thing with the Boy Scouts. I miss swimming in a lake, building camp fires, and exploring the country side. Maybe one day soon.
