I went to the Pismo fireworks show for the Fourth of July with Esther. I had never been before, but our timing was perfect. It was pretty cool, there were tons of people there, on the street near Splash and on the beach on either side of the pier. The place was pretty well lighted and there was plenty of space to sit on the beach. The fireworks were launched from the end of the pier and they seemed to explode pretty close to the ground. A few sparks seemed to almost hit the ocean before disappearing. The finale was pretty cool to watch because they showered sparks from the pier railings down to the water like a curtain of fire. There were tons of illegal fireworks too, which helped fill the gaps before and after the main show. We had barbecued earlier that afternoon, so it was a pretty good fourth. I hope everyone had fun.
