Woke up earlier than I expected, at about 8:30 AM. Read my Laos guidebook about the northern area to plan where to go next. Decided to go to the Plain of Jars next, and then to the wild debauchery of Vang Vieng. Walked around town with my guidebook and saw all the temples that I had missed the day before. Met a couple novice monks, Joy and Sing, and talked with them for about an hour. Sing was 19 and wanted to quit the temple life and enroll in a university. He wanted tips for flirting with girls and wanted to know about my dating life. It was very amusing. In the late afternoon I felt tired, so I returned to my hostel and rested for a bit, then went to the night market for dinner. Ran into Michelle and her friend and I ate with them and a guy from Australia who also sat with us. Bought some more banana bread on my way back to my hostel. Caught up on my blog and got my stuff ready to go in the morning.
