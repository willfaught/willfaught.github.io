title: Senate Republicans propose nixing filibuster for Supreme Court nominees
---

From http://cir.ca/s/ZjJ:

>Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Mike Lee (R-UT) proposed a rule change Feb. 4 to abolish the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. The proposal would allow approval of Supreme Court nominees with a simple majority. This would be so...sensible! I wonder what the motivation or context for this is?
