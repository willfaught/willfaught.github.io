It really came down today. I woke up bleary-eyed and tired, got up later than I meant to, and got ready. I didn't even glance outside until I was all set to go. I tried logging onto my Microsoft mail remotely to see if there was any mention of canceling work, but the mail servers were so impacted that the web pages wouldn't load. For a while I didn't know whether I should try to go or not, so I decided to try and see if I could even leave if I wanted to. There's two driveway exits for my building, and both lead onto steep hillsides that were caked with a couple inches of snow. Both ways I got a few feet out from the building and my car started to slide downhill, so I parked again and decided to work from home. It turns out I need to have a security certificate on my smart card changed, so I couldn't even work remotely today. It was nice to have a day to myself (I took a three-hour nap!), but I feel like an idiot for not trying to connect remotely before. It looks like I might not be able to drive tomorrow either, which either means going another day without working (not good) or trying to get to campus by bus to have my smart card fixed so I can work remotely from home. I'll have to wait until tomorrow morning to see how the roads are and whether the Microsoft shuttles are running.
