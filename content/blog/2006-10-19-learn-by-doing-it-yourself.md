I feel like an unacceptable portion of my class experience has been learning the material on my own. Granted, being able to learn something on my own is a good skill, but that’s not what I’m paying these people for. I’m sick and tired of walking out of lectures wanting my 50 minutes back. It’s such a relief to get a prof that I can understand. When will they learn that even though you have a PhD in something, you aren’t necessarily qualified to convey that knowledge to others. Some of these profs need to retake speech 101.
