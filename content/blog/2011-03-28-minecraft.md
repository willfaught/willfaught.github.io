I tried out Minecraft today. All I did was mine blocks and build stuff. Didn't see nighttime or zombies or spiders or anything else I've heard about. I was playing the free version, so maybe that stuff is paid only. The mining was surprisingly addictive, although it finally did get tiring after putting the finishing touches on my masterpiece. I ended up with a bridge and a staircase-turret-fire-pit thingy that was quite a lot of work to make.

By the way, I discovered (the hard way) that there's a limit on how high you can stack blocks.
