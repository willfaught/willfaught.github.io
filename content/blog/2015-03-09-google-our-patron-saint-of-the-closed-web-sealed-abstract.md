Drew Crawford on Google's application for the `.dev` domain:

>Let’s talk about a domain that’s near and dear to my heart, .dev. Wouldn’t it be great to have a domain for content targeted at software developers? So that you could actually get a domain name for www.[your-side-project].dev? Instead abusing the .io domain which is officially for the British Indian Ocean Territory.
>
>Alas, Google does not think much of that plan. Under their shell company “Charleston Road Registry Inc.” (whose “CEO” is merely Google’s in-house counsel), they have applied for control of the .dev domain, which they intend to be:
>
>>completely closed for the sole use of Google.
>
>In case you thought that was a typo, they elaborate:
>
>>Second-level domain names within the proposed gTLD are intended for registration and use by Google only, and domain names under the new gTLD will not be available to the general public for purchase, sale, or registration. As such, Charleston Road Registry intends to apply for an exemption to the ICANN Registry Operator Code of Conduct as Google is intended to be the sole registrar and registrant.

Unbelieveably brazen, but apparently ICANN has designed a system where this was possible, and thus inevitable. Google just got there first. I fault ICANN for being such idiots for allowing private control of domains.
