title: Running Out Of Space
---

I've accumulated 26.19 GB of pictures and videos on my travels so far. Soon their size will exceed the capacity of the 32 GB flash drive that I use to back them up. When that happens, all of my picture and video eggs will be in my laptop basket. Dropbox upload speeds are too slow to keep pace. At that point, I don't know what I can do, other than find a wifi connection with a fast upload speed. Good luck with that.
