title: Light Vs. Dark
---

Some people like to work on their computers with the lights off, and I can't for the life of me understand why or come to like it. You can't very well see the keyboard, your desk, or anything really. You have to squint into a bright light bulb for hours at a time, which I've heard isn't good for your eyes, and it doesn't seem to actually make the monitor easier to look at. I've seen offices partitioned into "light" and "dark", and it's just silly.

If I ever get stuck working in a dark office, I'll bring my own lighting and force anyone who wants to enter my office or cubicle to don the sunglasses and unfold the umbrella I will provide them to help shelter them from the unholy rays shining down upon them. The least I can do is be sensitive to their condition.
