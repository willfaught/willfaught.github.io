title: Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!
---

From http://www.learnyouahaskell.com/:

I've been reading this Haskell tutorial, and I'm almost finished with it. Most of it was review for me, but the sections on functors, applicative functors, monoids, monads, and zippers are very thorough and invaluable references. I love the tone of the writing and the artwork. It's so fanciful. I would totally buy this book if it were for sale. Check it out.
