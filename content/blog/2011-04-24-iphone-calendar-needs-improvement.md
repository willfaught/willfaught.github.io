I wholeheartedly agree with [Ben Brooks](https://brooksreview.net/2010/09/sucky-calendars/) and [Marco Arment](https://www.marco.org/2010/03/28/more-ideas-than-time-logarithmic-calendar-view): we need a new calendar view that presents the next three days like in a week view and then puts events for the following week or two in a list, all visible at once. Using landscape orientation would be perfect for this. At least give us a week view. Event repetition needs the flexibility that Google Calendar provides: I want events that can repeat every Tuesday *and* Thursday. Event details need to be in a bigger font. It would be nice if you could choose the color for each calendar.
