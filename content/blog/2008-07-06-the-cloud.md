title: The Cloud
---

I'm going to puke if I read about "[the cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)" or "cloud computing" one more time. It's become popular in the past half year but it doesn't describe anything new. Sometimes the computer tech industry has more ridiculous fads than fashion.
