Lost is back, baby! Season three kicked off a few weeks ago, and so far it’s off to a good start. I watched seasons one and two again with my mom this summer, so I’ve got everything fresh in my mind and ready to piece it all together. I’ve been listening to a really good podcast for Lost at [deltaparkproject.com/lost](https://www.deltaparkproject.com/lost/). Sadly, the season premiere wasn’t as good as season two’s, but oh well. It still had a really good beginning. I’m really glad Desmond and Locke made it through the season two finale; they were both too good to write off. And it was nice to have Boone back for a little bit. The best theory I’ve heard so far for what’s going on is that there are in fact *two* groups of Others; the Dharma Initiative members split into two factions and the people seen in the jungle by Eko and Jin with the teddy bear are a separate group. This would explain why Ben keeps referring to his group as the ‘good ones’. We’ll see. I’m lost as ever.
