From https://www.yahoo.com/tech/a-humble-proposition-how-to-fix-the-apple-watch-129185196924.html:

David Pogue on the shortcomings of the Apple Watch:

>On the Watch’s weird software layout, as noted earlier, apps aren’t anywhere at all. No matter where you start, you can’t swipe your way to the Home screen.

>The only way to find them is to click the Watch’s crown.

>OK, we could probably learn that: Clicking the crown is like clicking the Home button. Clicking it always opens the Home screen.

>Except that it doesn’t. If you’re in Glances or Notifications, pressing the crown once takes you back to the watch face; a second press opens the Home screen.

>Well, we could probably learn that: The first crown-click opens the watch face, and the second crown-click opens the Home screen.
Except that’s not always how it works, either.

>If you’re in an app, like Mail, the logic is reversed. This time, the first crown-click opens the Home screen, and the second crown-click opens the watch face!

>How is anyone supposed to learn that?

This was exactly my problem when I first tried using the Apple Watch. I was turned off because nothing made any sense; the mental model was too complicated and inconsistent.
