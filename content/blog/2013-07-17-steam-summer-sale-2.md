I just bought 17 games from the [Steam Summer Sale](http://steampowered.com): * Supreme Commander 2 * Alan Wake * Empire: Total War * Star Wars: KOTOR * Arma II: Combined Operations * Total War: Shogun 2 * Left 4 Dead 2 * Sins Trinity * Castle Crashers * Fallout New Vegas Ultimate * Kerbal Space Program * FTL: Faster Than Light * The Walking Dead * Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion * Hitman Absolution * FEZ * System Shock 2 The savings are addictive. I have enough games to last me a couple years!
