Rode a tuk tuk from my hostel to the airport. Flew to Taipei with a layover in Kuala Lumpur. Rode a bus to Taipei Main Station. Rode the MRT to Guting station. Walked to my hostel and arrived around 9:30 PM. Ate dinner at a nearby McDonald's (sorry, Tess). Met the others in my dorm room, English teachers from south of Taipei visiting for a long weekend. Played on my computer, then went to bed.
