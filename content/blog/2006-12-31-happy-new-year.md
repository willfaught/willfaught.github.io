title: Happy New Year!
---

Happy New Year, everyone! I had a great night. Sadly, I forgot to bring my camera and snap a few shots of my friends and I. I guess one of these days I’ll remember. Maybe if I get a slimmer camera.

My watch was off by about half a minute from the cell phone network time again, just like last year. The people around me were counting down to my watch while everyone else was staring intently at their cell phone screens, waiting for the minutes to hit zero. So there were two ‘Happy New Year!’ cheers at the party. Aaaaakward. My watch is synced up to a local time reference, so screw network time.

One of my New Year’s resolutions is to take dancing lessons. I’d like to learn ballroom, swing, and salsa dancing. I used to know three swing moves, but I realized last night that I had forgotten the coolest one of the three, so my dance moves are woefully inadequate for impressing the ladies. Learning more about wine would be really cool, too.
