title: Facebook Changed My Profile
---

At some point Facebook decided to convert everyone's profile information like Favorite Movies or Interests from free-form text to lists of Facebook pages. Now my profile doesn't say I like the TV show Heroes, but instead says I like the TV show Official HEROES Page. Terrible.

When they switched, they automatically matched up your profile's text with existing pages and converted it for you. Unfortunately, the exact meaning of the text can be lost. For example, under Interests, I put Girls (in a dating sense), but if you go to the Girls page, it shows two adorable young girls, no more than eight years old. Great, now I'm a pedophile.

Thank you, Facebook.
