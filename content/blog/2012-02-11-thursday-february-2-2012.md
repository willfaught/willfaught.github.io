Rented a scooter and rode it to Doi Suthep. On my way back, I came across a scooter accident that had just happened. The driver was a man from Nebraska named Paul. He was in really bad shape. All the skin on his right knee cap had been scraped off and he was bleeding heavily from his right arm. He took an antibacterial wipe and a clotting pad from my first aid kit and some toilet paper I had to soak up the blood from his arm. A very helpful Thai woman called an ambulance for him. I was reminded just how dangerous it was riding around on those things. Returned to the old quarter and then rode to Tiger Kingdom for some one-on-one time with some small and large tigers. Hired a photographer to take pictures of me with them. Returned to the old quarter again and then rode to the Arcade bus terminal to buy a bus ticket to Chiang Rai for the next day. Parked the scooter at the hostel, ate dinner, computer time, then bed.
