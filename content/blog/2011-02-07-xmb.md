The Cross Media Bar is the sleekest UI I've seen. Everything is ordered in a very structured, hierarchical way. You navigate it by doing up, down, left, and right movements that feel like drilling down into a tree, but look like a mix of scrolling a list and moving between pages. It has a very simple, minimal aesthetic, which pleases my own taste. I was disappointed to see that it won't also be used in Sony's NGP (PSP 2), but I can see that it wouldn't make for a good touch interface as-is.
