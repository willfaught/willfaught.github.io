Woke up at 7 AM. Got ready for the Angthong Marine Park island tour. The bus was late picking me up, but I got to the dock in time to eat the tiny breakfast and hot chocolate they served me. We started a little late, but they made up for it later. About forty people plus five or so staff. Lots of cold Cokes to go around throughout the day to slake our thirst. Snorkeled for an hour off one of the island karsts. Saw a few types of fish and got up close to some huge sea urchins. Swam above some divers and enjoyed the tickle of the bubbles. Went to an island with a beautiful emerald inland lake and a great lookout of the surrounding sea and islands. Ate a delicious lunch of green curry and vegetables, steamed rice, and sliced fruit on a beautiful sandy beach all to ourselves. Kayaked to a sandy spot on a nearby island and played in the water for an hour. Made a pit stop at another island. Returned to Ko Samui. Showered. Ten of us staying at my hostel went out for dinner at the nearby Thai restaurant, then got beers at the Focus Minimart across the street from the hostel and watched movies in the common room. Arranged for transportation to Ko Phangan the next morning. Went to bed around midnight.
