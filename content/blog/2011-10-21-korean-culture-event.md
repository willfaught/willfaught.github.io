A short video of the highlights from the Korean cultural event that I went to. There are shots of the crowd, but I didn't see myself. Maybe you can spot me? I was sitting center stage. The signs the people make with their thumb and forefinger or forefinger and middle finger are the letter 'V' for victory (I presume from the Korean War). It's a common pose for pictures.
