Programming languages vary across a spectrum of expressiveness. By expressiveness, I mean the ability and ease by which you can express something in a particular language. For example, programming languages having [closures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_science%29) are widely considered to be more expressive, and hence more powerful, than languages that lack this feature.

I wonder if natural (human) languages also vary in expressive power and if so how this affects your thinking and personality. If you grew up learning the most expressive natural language of all, would that make you smarter than those who didn't? Would it make you more predisposed to like certain things or enter certain careers? Maybe certain classes of ideas are easier to think about in certain natural languages, much like some programming languages are better suited to certain problem domains than others. Could this contribute to why some geographical areas are known for being good at a particular thing? Imagine having to learn Finnish because it was the best fit for thinking about ideas in your field of study or work. Imagine trying to invent a natural language to improve your thinking about your field of study of work.
