title: Zone Improvement Plan
---

>The term ZIP, an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan, is properly written in capital letters and was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently, and therefore more quickly (zipping along), when senders use the code in the postal address.

I don’t think I ever knew it was an acronym.
