Jake drove me to some of the smaller temples. I can't recall which ones, but aside from small features, they were very similar. After seeing temples for two days under a blistering sun, they all started to look alike and I grew weary of it. Returned to the hostel and arranged for a six-hour bus ride to Phnom Penh the next morning.
