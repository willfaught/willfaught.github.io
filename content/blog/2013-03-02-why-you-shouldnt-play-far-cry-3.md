title: Why you shouldn't play Far Cry 3
---

From http://www.cracked.com/blog/3-reasons-you-shouldnt-play-best-video-game-year/:

Packed with funny lines like this:

>We start off with possibly the least-likable protagonist in the history of video games, Jason Brody, whose only previous work experience was as an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch t-shirt tester. His distinguishing personality traits are “having white guy tribal tattoos” and “possibly wearing shorts.” I know personality seems like an odd thing to focus on in a first-person shooter, where the protagonists are traditionally mute and essentially invisible to the player. But silent characters like Link, Master Chief, Samus and Gordon Freeman get their personalities from the people reacting to them, and the way people react to Jason Brody is to humbly cup his messianic balls for having the graciousness to show up on their savage, backward island with all of his beautiful whiteness.

And this:

>Ubisoft makes this game, and they have fucked up the back-end like they always do. Their own brand of always-on DRM, Uplay, permeates Far Cry 3. Which means that, if you buy the game through a service that is, itself, essentially pure DRM — like, oh, say, the largest digital game delivery system in existence [Steam] — you get to eat an entire layer-cake of frustration every time you boot up the game. Starting up Far Cry 3 through Steam is like throwing an Inception-themed orgy: Everybody’s not only fucking you, but also each other, and themselves, locked forever in an eternal cycle of meta-boning.
