title: Presentation Tips
---

If you ever have to give a 40+ minute presentation about a [paper](https://www.cs.utah.edu/%7Ewilson/compilers/old/papers/p157-landin.pdf) you don’t adequately understand, the following tips may help:

- Copy every major idea verbatim into your notes and read that to your audience.

- Ask your professor to explain the things you didn’t understand whenever possible.

- Waste time by copying every example from the paper onto the board and explaining them in detail.

- Have a partner and alternate talking about topics. The one not speaking can read ahead in the paper or notes to prepare for the next topic.

I suppose you could play dumb to stretch the second one out. I think that was the longest hour and a half of my life, or close to it. [Landin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Landin) can’t write to save his life and can bite my shiny metal ass.
