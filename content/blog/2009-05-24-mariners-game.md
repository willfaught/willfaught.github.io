title: Mariners Game
---

I went to the Mariners vs. Giants game on Friday. I don't usually enjoy baseball games in person or on TV, but a friend invited me, and I thought I'd give it another shot.

The innings went surprisingly fast. I missed a lot of the game because I was chatting or drinking my beer. There was a funny Giants fan wearing a bandana a few seats away from us who stood periodically to silently taunt the Mariners fans behind him. The big screen fixed for a whole minute on a man who was a really good dancer. He did the best he could with the three inches of foot room they give you, and even danced to the stair railing for a dance prop. A lot of short music clips would play in between batters. They would get people clapping, then cut off as the batter stepped up to the plate.

I couldn't believe that they interrupted the entire baseball game to show the last few seconds of a close basketball game happening live elsewhere. It was an exciting ending, though. I didn't catch who was playing, but it was tied, then one team scored two points, then, with one second left, the other team scored three points!

The score was 1 to 1 for most of the game, but the pieces fell into place, and at the bottom of the ninth with the bases loaded and two outs, the Mariners put Ken Griffey, Jr. to bat. The crowd got really excited and everyone stood up. It was a perfect set up for a grand slam to win the game, and I think everyone was hoping for it. He hit one pretty far into the outfield, but sadly it was caught. The game went downhill from there, although the Mariners did win by a few points.

I was really tired by the end. I'm still on vacation time.
