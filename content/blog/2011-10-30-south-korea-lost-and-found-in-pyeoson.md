title: 'South Korea: Lost And Found In Pyeoson'

*For Wednesday, October 19, 2011*

**Jeju City**

I rode the bus to [Pyeoson](https://g.co/maps/3g37a) in the southeast corner of Jeju island to visit the [Jeju Folk Village Museum](https://www.google.com/search?q=Jeju+Folk+Village+Museum). I wasn't sure if I had gotten off on the right stop, and after walking around for a half hour, I gave up and took a taxi straight there, which had been in the direction opposite that I had been walking. I spent a couple hours walking around the outdoor museum with a headset that spoke English descriptions. The only things I really found interesting were the ways the ancient islanders ground food and the photographs of the women islanders who dove and fished for food. I rode the bus back to Joseph Tree Guesthouse to pick up my pack, then headed on to Jeju City to my next hostel, [Backpackers in Jeju](https://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Backpackers-in-Jeju/Jeju-Island/55056). I checked in, then grabbed some hot chocolate and a few donuts at a nearby Dunkin Donuts and sat in the common room, snacking and trying to figure out how to upload my camera pictures using a computer that was all in Korean. I ended up giving up. I tried to go to bed early for my hike up [Hallasan](https://www.google.com/search?q=Hallasan) early the next morning.
