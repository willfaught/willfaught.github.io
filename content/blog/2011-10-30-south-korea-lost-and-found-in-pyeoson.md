title: 'South Korea: Lost and found in Pyeoson'

*For Wednesday, October 19, 2011* **Jeju City** I rode the bus to [Pyeoson](http://g.co/maps/3g37a) in the southeast corner of Jeju island to visit the [Jeju Folk Village Museum](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls;=en&q;=Jeju+Folk+Village+Museum&oe;=UTF-8&um;=1&ie;=UTF-8&hl;=en&tbm;=isch&source;=og&sa;=N&tab;=wi&biw;=1366&bih;=690&sei;=%20gfqsTsyWBZGbmQXIt5HRDg). I wasn't sure if I had gotten off on the right stop, and after walking around for a half hour, I gave up and took a taxi straight there, which had been in the direction opposite that I had been walking. I spent a couple hours walking around the outdoor museum with a headset that spoke English descriptions. The only things I really found interesting were the ways the ancient islanders ground food and the photographs of the women islanders who dove and fished for food. I rode the bus back to Joseph Tree Guesthouse to pick up my pack, then headed on to Jeju City to my next hostel, [Backpackers in Jeju](http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Backpackers-in-Jeju/Jeju-Island/55056). I checked in, then grabbed some hot chocolate and a few donuts at a nearby Dunkin Donuts and sat in the common room, snacking and trying to figure out how to upload my camera pictures using a computer that was all in Korean. I ended up giving up. I tried to go to bed early for my hike up [Hallasan](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls;=en&q;=Jeju+Folk+Village+Museum&oe;=UTF-8&um;=1&ie;=UTF-8&hl;=en&tbm;=isch&source;=og&sa;=N&tab;=wi&biw;=1366&bih;=690&sei;=%20gfqsTsyWBZGbmQXIt5HRDg#um=1&hl;=en&client;=safari&rls;=en&tbm;=isch&sa;=1&q;=Hallasan&pbx;=1&oq;=Hallasan&aq;=f&aqi;=g4g-m2g-S4&aql;=1&gs;_sm=e&gs;_upl=298336l298336l0l299221l1l1l0l0l0l0l232l232l2-1l1l0&bav;=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&fp;=e85638aef1ce869b&biw;=1366&bih;=690) early the next morning.
