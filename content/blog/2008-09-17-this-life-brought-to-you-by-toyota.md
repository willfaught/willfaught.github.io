I went with Heather to Discovery Kingdom (formerly Marine World) in Vallejo last weekend. We had a lot of fun. They have several roller coasters in addition to the animal displays and shows that make for an entertaining time. I was surprised at how commercialized it was, though. There were ads everywhere you looked. It seemed like everything was sponsored or brought to us by companies other than Six Flags. They even interrupted the whale show for a thirty second Toyota commercial to play on the jumbo video screen! What is going on here? Why do they need advertising if they're charging us to get in and for the food we buy? Is this a cheap way to lower the ticket prices? That would be a pretty low thing to do, since there's no expectation of that sort of thing. It would be like going to a movie theater and being forced to sit through an intermission for showing you commercials. I thought the point of paying for something was so you don't have to deal with ads. It's like I'm being charged twice: once for the ticket, once for the annoyance of the ads.
