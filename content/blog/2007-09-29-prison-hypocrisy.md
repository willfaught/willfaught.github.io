I was watching a Law and Order episode in which someone who framed an innocent person was sent to prison because the framed person was killed in prison. The prisons were so dangerous that the district attorneys considered it a heinous crime to send someone there. It's ironic that many states do not use the death penalty but use prisons that can accomplish the same thing as well as reinforce aggressive and violent behavior.
