*For Sunday, October 30, 2011*

**Tokyo**

I woke up feeling sicker than ever: sore throat, dehydrated, and exhausted. I tried to sleep in as much as I could, but the sounds of roommates and cleaners eventually forced me awake. I contemplated going with Chris (from Australia) and Stephen (from New Zealand/Canada) to the [National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation](https://www.google.com/search?q=national+museum+of+emerging+science+and+innovation), but I didn't feel up to it. I tried to call Tess at 2 PM, but couldn't reach her, then realized I was calling a day early because it was Sunday here, but Saturday there. D'oh! It rained a little in the afternoon, so I decided to just stay in today and rest and catch up on my blogging. (As of today, I'm finally caught up!) Chris and Stephen returned and we walked to a highly-rated [ramen](https://www.google.com/search?q=ramen) restaurant near the Asakusa temple complex (Sensoji) for dinner. I had decided to spend my second week in Japan in Kyoto, so I booked a hostel in Kyoto. Chris (from Australia) is heading that way at the same time, so we may catch the same bullet train. I've heard that Kyoto is even more fun than Tokyo, with more temples and better night life, so I'm excited to move on.
