title: Inside Out
---

I just realized my shirt was inside out all day today. The tag is plain as day, and highlighted with a colored border. Kind of like a target, so people could conclude from a distance that I'm an idiot. The seams were also inside out. I don't know how I could miss all that. Come on, Will!
