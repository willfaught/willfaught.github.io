title = "Manhattan DA: Smartphone Encryption Will Endanger New Yorkers"
+++

Cyrus Vance:

>[Encrypted smartphones] cannot be accessed by law enforcement, even when a court has authorized us to look at its contents. The implication of this is that it's going to affect our ability to protect New Yorkers.

Replace "encrypted smartphones" with "private thoughts" and it makes just as much sense.
