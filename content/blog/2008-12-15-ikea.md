title: IKEA
---

The IKEA stuff I bought is so eager to become faulty that it started before I even finished setting it up. The dresser I bought was horribly damaged as it was delivered to my apartment, the screws for my dining table — despite my best efforts and aching hands — don't fit their holes, and a finished surface of my dining table is cracked. I'll have to return both items. I'm questioning now whether I should let them keep their stuff and go elsewhere for furniture. Everyone says IKEA is cheap, but $300 for a dresser and $300 for a dining table don't sound like great deals when you have to assemble them and wait for them to be exchanged for new ones.
