It's amusing that Republican politicians throw around the word "liberal" like it's a dirty word, an unthinkable state of affairs, rather than the counterpart to their own extremism on the opposite end of the political spectrum. As if the word itself makes their argument for them. They're just so scandalized by it. I never hear the word "conservative" used this way.
