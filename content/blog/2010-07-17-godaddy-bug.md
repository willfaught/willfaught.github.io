If you use GoDaddy and have trouble using their Total DNS Control feature to configure your domains, try permitting all cookies, or permitting cookies from secureserver.net, or using another browser, like Firefox. I kept getting an error saying the feature was unavailable, so I couldn't redirect my domain name to Blogger. I tried using Firefox instead of Safari and it magically worked.
