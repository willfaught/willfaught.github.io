I sawÂ *The Incredible Hulk* tonight and it was pretty much what I expected: light on story, heavy on action. The action scenes looked great, especially the scene on a campus. The end action scene looked too CGI-ish and I kept noticing it. I was looking forward to seeing another movie with Edward Norton in it since he's usually good (Fight Club!), but he seemed kind of wasted on this movie. His character, Banner, was flat and uninteresting. He did a good job with what he had to work with, but it still left me wanting something more. Overall a good summer action flick without a lot of depth. (Spoiler!) I'm interested in seeing where they go with bringing Iron Man into the mix. (End spoiler.)

I always cringe when I watch a movie preview and at the end they show a domain name dedicated to the movie, such as [transformersmovie.com](https://www.transformersmovie.com/). They probably get, what, a couple hundred hits before the movie releases? Meanwhile they're polluting the domain namespace. So messy. What's wrong with transformers.studio.com?
