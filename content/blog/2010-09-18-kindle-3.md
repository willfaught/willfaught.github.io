I recently bought a Kindle 3 to condense the space occupied by my book collection and to make it portable, searchable, annotatable, and replaceable. The average $10 per book isn't bad, especially now when I only read a couple books a month. It's light, slim, attractive, readable, and has long battery life. Reading the paper-like screen noticeably strains my eyes less than my iPad's LCD screen. It's somewhat astonishing that it can display images without using power. The UI is good and pretty discoverable, although screen refreshes are sluggish despite recent improvements, and the arrow buttons are hard to press with my thumb. I wish the books weren't protected by DRM, but this doesn't hinder me at the moment. At $139, it's tough to say no to trying it out, and I'm glad I did. I plan to buy all my new books with it when possible from now on.
