I started my holiday vacation this evening! Well, actually I started it around 1 PM since I couldn't drive to work or work remotely and I realized the latter about then. So I effectively had two extra days of vacation, yesterday and today, but they didn't really feel like vacation since I felt so bad for being an idiot and not setting up my work computers to accept remote connections in advance. Oh well, at least this won't happen again.

I'll be flying home at 5 PM tomorrow and won't be coming back until January 5, two full weeks at home. I'm looking forward to seeing family and friends again, sleeping in, working on my thesis, and catching up on Bill Mahr. I finished the Hyperion books a couple days ago, so I may pick another favorite off my bookshelf while I'm there.
