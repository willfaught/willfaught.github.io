The big thing touted for Windows Phone 7 as the innovation over iPhone is hubs: information aggregated into one place and viewable at a glance. It seems to me that Apple could easily add such a feature to the home screen by letting you drag downward or upward to view a Dashboard like in Mac OS X that you can put widgets on that call out whatever information you care about&mdash;upcoming calendar events, missed calls, new messages, weather, whatever. They could do the same for the lock screen. If they do those things, I don't think Windows Phone 7 would have any advantage over iPhone. Microsoft is taking a big bet that Apple won't simply copy that one feature if it proves popular.
