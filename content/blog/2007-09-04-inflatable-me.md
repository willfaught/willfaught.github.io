+++

Being a computer science major, my job after graduation will most likely entail working in an office. I'll have to attend meetings. If I'm promoted, I'll have to attend even more meetings. If I progress higher into the ranks, I'll lose more and more of my day to the time suck of meetings to the point where I can't get anything useful done during normal hours. I'll have to develop a second personality to come into the office to get something done at night while I rest up, hopefully while not starting a club at the same time.

It would be nice to have an Inflatable Me that could take my place at meetings, speak only when spoken to or nudged, and never commit me to more work. For example, when a fellow prisoner-of-meeting asks Inflatable Me something, it could say things like:

- That can't be done.
- I'll have to check my spreadsheet.
- My sources say no.

What else could it say?
