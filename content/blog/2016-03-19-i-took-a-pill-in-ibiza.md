title: I Took a Pill in Ibiza

Mike Posner on the popularity of the remix of his song *I Took a Pill in Ibiza*:

>If they want to party and do all the things I say brought me sadness in my song, with my song as the soundtrackâ€¦so be it. Then maybe they can get some ironies going in their life as I have in mine. When did God or whatever divinity orchestrating my life and career become such a prankster?

It's an interesting problem, the audience not hearing or understanding the lyrics. I myself have trouble understanding a lot of lyrics. I'm glad he worked so hard to make them more audible.
