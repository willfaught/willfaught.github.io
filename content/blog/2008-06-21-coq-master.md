title: Coq Master
---

I've started learning a theorem proving tool to help me with my thesis. It's calledÂ [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr), which has got to be the most unfortunate name I can think of. I think the creators are French, and coq means cock, as in rooster, in French. Why rooster? I have no idea. Why does anyone name anything what they do?

I wonder which seemingly-innocent English words mean something equally awkward in other languages?
