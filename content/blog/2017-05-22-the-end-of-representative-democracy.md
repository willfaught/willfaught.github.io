title: The end of representative democracy
---

Scott Adams:

>That isn’t necessarily bad news. The Republic form of government doesn’t make sense in the modern world anyway. We already evolved into a form of direct democracy via social media and polling. Our politicians can’t risk going against a big majority – even for noble reasons – because social media will organize to drive that person out of office over the issue. In effect, we are already a direct democracy. The Republic is already history, except in a technical sense.

I hadn't really thought of it this way, but I agree. Politicians' desire to stay in office, combined with the wide and prompt dissemination of information, effectively makes the U.S. government a direct democracy. It's supposed to be a representative democracy.

I see his point about the "hope" comment (see the full post), but I'm not convinced that there's a pattern that could be construed as character assassination. Trump is doing a fine job hanging himself.
