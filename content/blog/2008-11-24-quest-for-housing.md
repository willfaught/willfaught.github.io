I need to find a permanent place to live soon because Microsoft stops paying for my temporary housing on December 3. For a long time I thought I would look for a place to live in [Eastside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastside_(King_County,_Washington)), probably [Bellevue](https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&safe=off&client=safari&q=bellevue,+wa&ie=UTF8&z=11&g=bellevue,+wa), because I don't want to deal with the traffic crossing the Lake Washington bridges and I would be closer to work. Lately, after having worked for a couple weeks now, I realize that if I live in Eastside, it's not as likely that I'll have the energy or time to drive to Seattle to explore the city, which I really want to do. I figure I should just plant myself there and then I can't help but immerse myself in it. Microsoft provides a lot of commuting alternatives &mdash; I heard they own and run the largest private bus network in the nationÂ &mdash; so traffic might not be as bad as it could be. The Microsoft Connector buses even have internet access.

Right now I'm focusing on the [Capitol Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill,_Seattle,_Washington) district. After talking to coworkers and friends who live here, this seems like an interesting place to be and a good place to get my feet wet (pun definitely intended). I hear a lot of people live there and it's very busy and exciting and hip with lots of things to do. I hope I can find a place that I like. Microsoft has put me in touch with a rental provider, who is putting together a list of potential places to look at, and later she'll take me on a tour of the ones I like. Wish me luck!
