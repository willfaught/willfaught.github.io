I've been doing a lot of Java development with Eclipse this past quarter and this past summer. Eclipse has a really neat code formatting tool that you can kick off with a quick Ctrl-Shift-F or Command-F to tidy up your code. When I use Eclipse, I regularly format my code along with saving it. Now I find myself reaching for the format shortcut when I write for my fiction writing class. Weird.
