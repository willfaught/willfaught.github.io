*For Monday, October 31, 2011* **Tokyo** Still being sick, I let myself sleep in again. The weather was still gray and dreary, so again I decided to stay inside and take it easy. I called Tess at 2 p.m. and caught up with her. In the evening, I went out to eat [okonomiyaki](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls;=en&q;=okonomiyaki&oe;=UTF-8&um;=1&ie;=UTF-8&hl;=en&tbm;=isch&source;=og&sa;=N&tab;=wi&biw;=1366&bih;=690&sei;=%20tFS1TrjBAsyVmQXW0tD2Aw) — kind of like a Japanese pancake — delicious! — for dinner with Chris and Billy (both from Australia), Damian and Aliena (both from Canada), and Angelica and Felix (both from Sweden).
