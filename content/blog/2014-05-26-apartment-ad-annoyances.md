If you're going to advertise an apartment for rent, be sure to:

- Provide an email address. I don't want to wait until you're awake or not eating dinner to contact you.
- Show large pictures of the interior, including the bedrooms and bathrooms.
- Mention if there are fewer dedicated parking spaces than there are bedrooms.
- Mention if there is no microwave.
