Rode a minibus with Aimee, Glenn, Nic, Sara, Dan, Sylvia, Michelle, and Ingo to the gorgeous Kuang Si waterfalls. Took lots of pictures, swam, swung on a rope and jumped off a small cliff into the icy blue water. Hiked up to all the different pools and falls. Got lost coming down the other side of the falls and ended up taking the long way back to the bottom of the falls. Returned to the hostel. Hiked Phou Si hill for a view of Luang Prabang at sunset with a girl from my dorm named Monica (from Australia). Walked with Monica to another popular bar and lounge I'd heard about called Utopia. Ate dinner and drank beers and chatted with Monica, her friends, and Bernard (from Austria) and Jenny (from Finland), who were also from our dorm. Walked home when curfew closed the bar and chatted with Bernard and Jenny a little more around a campfire at the hostel.
