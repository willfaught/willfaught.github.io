Ah!  It's good to be done with that.  It was such a burden, having that hanging over my head.  Kind of like the ring of power, except not really cool, or gold.  Looking back, I can't believe how long it took to write.  Sadly, there's still more to do, too.  I'm waiting to get feedback from my adviser, after which I'll probably have to make some changes.  I still have to finish up a coding project that goes along with the thesis document, but hopefully that won't be too much more work.  Then I have to drive back to SLO at some point to defend the thing.  I decided to move home now since there's no point in sitting around SLO for almost a month before I can defend.  I'm looking forward to seeing my friends at home.  I wish there was more summer, I feel like I've missed out on the majority of it.
