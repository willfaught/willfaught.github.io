Some gems:

- They were posted one "sprint" apart. ðŸ¤£
- "Itâ€™s really Waterfall with meetings every two weeks."
- "Thatâ€™s Greg. His birthday is on day 2 of sprint 7."
- "We don't even define requirements until after production."
- "I lost my job because I'm a horrible developer. Now I'm an Agile coach."
- "Always change. Never finish."
- "Folks who don't have anything valuable to add deserve meetings."
- "I'm so used to it, I don't even hear the Waterfall."
- "Don't give customers what they need; give them what they ask for."
- "The company was working fine before I introduced Scrum."
- "That's why they have me: to make Waterfall look like Scrum."
