title: Human Works As Phallic Symbols
---

From time to time I hear people characterize human works as phallic symbols, as if the single unifying motivation for the (assumed) men who created these things were their penises. Do people really buy into that kind of Freudian analysis? The more reasonable explanation, in my opinion, is that things worth constructing, like buildings, tools, and monuments, occupy volume and thus take up space, stand above ground, and are probably tall. If the genital symbolism were true, but women had done most of the building, we'd all be dwelling in the darkness of pits, tunnels, and underground caverns, digging pot holes to worship our gods, which is ridiculous. If it's a giant statue of a penis, fine, I'll grant you that one, but otherwise, use some common sense: it's cool to build tall shit.
