Woke up still sick. Went downstairs for a breakfast of cereal and toast. Took a while getting ready. Called Tess. Wanted to talk to the hostel staff about getting a map of Ko Phuket, where to get lunch, and where to rent a scooter, but I couldn't find anyone. It was already past 1 p.m., so I left on my own. Found a small place for lunch and had pork fried rice. Kept going and found a couple places that rented scooters, but neither had a helmet that fit me, and one shop didn't even have an automatic shift scooter. Walked up and down the streets of Phuket Town looking for a rental shop with a helmet that fit me, but never found one. Returned to my hostel to ask where I could buy my own helmet, then went there, but the helmets were much too expensive for a one-time use. It was late in the afternoon by then and the light was waning. Resigned to losing the day. Returned to my hostel and arranged through the front desk to do a boat and kayak tour of the nearby Phang Nga islands (as seen in the James Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun) the next day. Researched where to stay on Ko Phi Phi. Caught up on my blog. Chatted with a German in my room. Prepared for bed, then went to sleep.
