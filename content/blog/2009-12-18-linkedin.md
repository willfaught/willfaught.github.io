I signed up for a LinkedIn account a while ago. I can't remember how it happened. I know it wasn't because all the cool kids were doing it. Maybe I did it just in case it turned into something big, and then I'd already be registered. Anyways, I never use it, but I periodically get 'acquaintance' requests (there's nothing fun or friendly about them; the lame default message that everyone uses is something like "I would like to establish a connection with you") from people I know in person, and occasionally from people I've never met. It's a chore. Sign in, accept, sign out. I don't look back. I don't know why I do it. I don't know why other people do it, either. I never hear anyone talk about being on LinkedIn. It's such a boring place to be. 'Connecting' with connections just to network is so uninteresting. I'm pretty sure my profile doesn't have any of my work information past my second or third year of college. I guess the point is that LinkedIn should just die and we can all stop feeling obligated to maintain our presence there. Good riddance.
