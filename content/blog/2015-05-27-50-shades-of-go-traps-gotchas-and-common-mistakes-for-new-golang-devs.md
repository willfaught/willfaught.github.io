From http://devs.cloudimmunity.com/gotchas-and-common-mistakes-in-go-golang/index.html#close_http_conn:

Kyle Quest has a lot of good tips for Golang newcomers, and arguably even intermediate ones:

>A lot of these gotchas may seem obvious if you took the time to learn the language reading the official spec, wiki, mailing list discussions, many great posts and presentations by Rob Pike, and the source code.
