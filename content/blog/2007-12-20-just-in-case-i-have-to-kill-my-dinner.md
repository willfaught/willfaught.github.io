title: Just In Case I Have To Kill My Dinner
---

I went to a shooting range several weeks ago for my friend Jose's birthday. I had never been to a firing range before. There were about ten of us and the range was divided into five lanes. Each lane had a different pistol and boxes of ammunition that you used to reload the weapon when it was your turn.

I had never fired a pistol before, but I was still surprised at how nervous I was to fire a pistol. I wasn't alone; several other people there hadn't done it before either and were also nervous. I had no idea it was so tough to load a clip of ammunition; those springs are tense! I was able to fire most of the guns two or three times, five to ten shots per turn. I usually gripped the gun tightly and just squeezed one off in the general direction of the target without really caring about my aim just to get used to the loud noise and sudden motion. Then I could get into it and focus my aim.

Towards the end, they swapped out the circular targets we were using for some posters of terrorists holding women hostage. I decided to take the easy way out and shoot the women instead. I ended up getting one woman in her open mouth dead center and also square in her chest. Yes, I'm that incredible.
