Ars reader Bad Monkey in a comment on an Ars post about it being 10 years since Valve announced Half-Life 2 Episode 3 and then left us hanging:

>A day at "work" for a Valve staffer:
>
>9am: Arrive at work. Socialize in corridors for half an hour with coworkers, then head to the company cafeteria for breakfast. Free trade coffee and greek yogurt. Socialize with coworkers in cafeteria for 45 minutes.
>
>10:30am: make it to desk. spend half an hour catching up on emails, and sorting HL3 inquiries and Steam customer service complaints to the trash folder. Whew, that was rough, you need a break! Get up to stretch and take a walk, socialize with coworkers at their "workstations" for half an hour.
>
>11:30am: time to hit the gym. Head down to the company gym, and spend the next hour alternately browsing Insta-Tweet-Book, idly pedaling on the stationary bike, and socializing with coworkers.
>
>12:30pm: After a quick rinse and change of clothes, time for lunch! Back to the cafeteria for some nosh and socializing.
>
>1:30pm: Lunch is over back to the desk. Catching up on more emails. Damn, it's almost 2pm, better get some work done.
>
>2:00pm - 3:30pm: work on the new implementation of a physics-based headcrab hat for TF2.
>
>3:30pm: get up for a stretch and walk, spend next 30 minutes socializing with coworkers. Somebody's running up a helluva streak on DOTA2.
>
>4:00pm: oh would you look at the time! You need to jet before traffic gets too bad on the 405. You get back to your workstation, check the email one last time, making sure to trash all the HL3 related stuff, lock up and head for the door. On the way out, meet up with some coworkers also trying to beat the afternoon rush, and everyone decides to head to the bar. You joke that we can't stay out too late tonight, because we have work tomorrow. Everybody laughs.

So funny it hurts.
