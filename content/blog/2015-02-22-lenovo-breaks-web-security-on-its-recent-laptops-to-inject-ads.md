title: "Lenovo breaks web security on its recent laptops to inject ads"

From https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/further-evidence-lenovo-breaking-https-security-its-laptops:

The Electronic Frontier Foundation:

>News broke last night that Lenovo has been shipping laptops with a horrifically dangerous piece of software called Superfish, which tampers with Windows' cryptographic security to perform man-in-the-middle attacks against the user's browsing. This is done in order to inject advertising into secure HTTPS pages, a feature most users don't want implemented in the most insecure possible way.

Inexcusable and egregious.
