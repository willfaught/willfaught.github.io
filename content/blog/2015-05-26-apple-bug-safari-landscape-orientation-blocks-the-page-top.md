title: 'Apple bug: Safari landscape orientation blocks the page top'
---

Viewed a [page](https://talks.go-zh.org/2015/gofmt-en.slide) in landscape orientation that didn’t scroll vertically. Dragged left on the page with one finger to interact with the page. The address bar popped down from the top of the screen, hiding the content there, and I couldn’t hide it without changing the orientation to portrait and then back.

iOS 8.3, iPhone 6
