>Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and run effectively.

>Mesos is built using the same principles as the Linux kernel, only at a different level of abstraction. The Mesos kernel runs on every machine and provides applications (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Elastic Search) with API's for resource management and scheduling across entire datacenter and cloud environments.

Another cool cluster management idea. It even integrates Kubernetes.

There's an [enterprise version](https://mesosphere.com) as well.
