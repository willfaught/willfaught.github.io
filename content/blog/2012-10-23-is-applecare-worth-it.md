Marco Arment:

>Personally, I've stopped buying extended warranties on almost everything, with the rationale that if I ever actually need to repair something out of warranty and it costs me a much larger amount of money than I would have been spending on extended warranties, I'll start buying them from that point forward.

Makes sense to me.
