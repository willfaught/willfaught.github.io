That's when I woke up this morning. I went to bed around 12:30 a.m. My body is dumb. The upside is that I got quite a bit done this morning before work. I want to try getting up regularly two or three hours earlier than usual to see if that makes any lasting impact on my productivity. I've never been a morning person, so I won't hold my breath.
