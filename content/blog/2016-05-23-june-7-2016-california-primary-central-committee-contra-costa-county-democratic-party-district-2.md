From http://www.votersedge.org/ca/en/ballot/election/39-46748b/address/null/zip/94596/contests/contest/11039#top-3-priorities-125869:

Why is this even on the ballot? What do I care about who runs a private organization? Why is this being done with taxpayer money? Who is even qualified to decide among these candidates? I haven't heard of any of them, there wasn't any information about them in the voter guide pamphlet, and there's scarce information online. It's as bad as asking me to vote on judges.
