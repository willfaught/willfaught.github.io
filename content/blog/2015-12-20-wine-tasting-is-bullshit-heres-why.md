title: Wine Tasting Is Bullshit. Here's Why.
---

Robbie Gonzales, writing for io9:

>The human palate is arguably the weakest of the five traditional senses. This raises an important question regarding wine tasting: is it bullshit, or is it complete and utter bullshit?
>
>There are no two ways about it: the bullshit is strong with wine. Wine tasting. Wine rating. Wine reviews. Wine descriptions. They're all related. And they're all egregious offenders, from a bullshit standpoint.

Even more information about the fallacies of wine tasting and judgment. It's interesting that amateurs are less happy with expensive wines. Works for me!
