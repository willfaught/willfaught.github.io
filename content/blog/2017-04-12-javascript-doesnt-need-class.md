title: JavaScript Doesn't Need Class
---

Ian Elliot:

>JavaScript is the single most important programming language and yet, as it reaches its high point, everyone is complaining about it and there are significant efforts to replace it with something better - Go, Dart, Coffeescript. Even the people who love it seem to misunderstand it because they want to add "class". JavaScript doesn't need class! And if you think it does you need to look more carefully at JavaScript.

I'd never quite thought of JavaScript in this way. Thought-provoking.
