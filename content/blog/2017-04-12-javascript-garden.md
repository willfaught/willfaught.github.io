From http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/:

Ivo Wetzel:

>JavaScript Garden is a growing collection of documentation about the most quirky parts of the JavaScript programming language. It gives advice to avoid common mistakes and subtle bugs, as well as performance issues and bad practices, that non-expert JavaScript programmers may encounter on their endeavours into the depths of the language.

Really good resource.
