title: What Kind Of Thing Is That?
---

Have you ever wondered, "What kind of thing is that?" I use Wikipedia to answer that question all the time. You can even use Wikipedia to find similar things that share the same category. What kind of thing is a [senate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate)? Well, apparently it's a [legislature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Legislatures). Did you know that a [tricameral legislature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Tricameral_legislatures) is also a kind of legislature, and that there was a [Tricameral Parliament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricameral_Parliament) in South Africa until 1994? You could spend all day exploring the order of things.
