Steve Jobs humbly presents to the Cupertino City Council Apple's plans to build a new Cupertino campus. The campus would be just a few blocks away from their current one. There would be only one large, ring-shaped building (the new infinite loop), four or five stories tall. Lots of parking would be provided underground and in a nearby parking structure. 80% of the area, including the circular area inside the loop, would be landscaped, and the number of trees would double from about 3,000 to about 6,000. The building would hold about 12,000 employees. Apple would continue to use the old Cupertino campus as well. I like the design. The only downside I can see to working in the new loop would be the lunch lines at the cafe and getting from the parking structure to the building. Maybe they'll have trams or buses or something.
