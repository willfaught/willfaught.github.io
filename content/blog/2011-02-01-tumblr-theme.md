I really like my Tumblr theme. It's called Easy Reader, and it's free. In the past, I've left blog services because I wasn't satisfied with the blog themes they had available for free. I'm a big fan of simplicity. There's just something satisfying about good presentation. Hopefully this will entice me to stick around and blog more.
