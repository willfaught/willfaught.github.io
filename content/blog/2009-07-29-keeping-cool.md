It was 105 degrees today in Seattle! It's almost midnight, and it's eighty-three degrees now. No one in Washington has air conditioning. These people are completely unprepared for the elements. This place is known for a single element&mdash;rain&mdash;and people don't use umbrellas. I'm sitting on my bed, under my only ceiling fan, with my only desk fan two feet away and pointed straight at me. I meant to actually do something with my time tonight, but it was just too hot. Better to sip juice and watch a movie under a fan. Hamburgers weren't the best hot weather food, but that meat was on the verge of going bad. I've observed several times that a chill runs down my back and I get goose-bumps when I listen to Stairway To Heaven by Led Zeppelin. Maybe I can keep that going.

I learned today that 'epitamy' isn't a word, and that 'epitome' isn't pronounced how I thought it was. I didn't learn until a friend corrected me at college that 'inventory' is pronounced ***I***nventory, not inv***E***ntory.
