[Mac OS Lion](http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/) looks promising:

  * Choose and organize apps like iOS
  * Full screen apps
  * Better way to see running apps
  * File changes are saved automatically
  * File versions are stored and accessible like Time Machine
  * Restarting saves the state of running apps and restores them automatically
  * Easy file sharing with any Mac on your network
  * Server with wiki

These are substantial new features that I would love to have. This is the kind of innovation I admire.
