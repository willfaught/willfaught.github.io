I was reinstalling Windows for a friend the other day. After the installation, I upgraded everything. Service Pack 2 was giving me some trouble because every time I tried to install it, Windows would freeze half way through. I tried it two or three times before I decided to bring up the Task Manager to watch the processor load as the installer worked. Poof! Like a charm, the problem disappeared. Cooincidence? I think not. It's like Windows knows when you're really watching, sits up straight, and gets to work, and then slouches again when you turn away.
