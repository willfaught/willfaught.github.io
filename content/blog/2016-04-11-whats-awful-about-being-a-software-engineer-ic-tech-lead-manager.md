title: What's awful about being a software engineer IC, tech lead & manager
---

Brett Slatner on the trials and tribulations of being a software engineering individual contributor, tech lead, and manager:

>I've been building software professionally for over 10 years now. I love what I do and I hope to be an old programmer someday. But along the way, I've encountered many terrible things that have made me hate my job. I wish that someone had given me a roadmap of what to expect earlier in my career, so when some new and unfortunate awfulness occurred that I wouldn't have felt so alone and frustrated.

Some are so simply worded and yet true that they're funny.
