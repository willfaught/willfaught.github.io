Linux distributions should stop separating things into the three directory hierarchies at `/`, `/usr`, and `/usr/local`. Just put all the binaries in `/bin`, all the libraries in `/lib`, etc. Why can't that work? There's no need to have files on separate partitions nowadays; it's not like it's running on a toaster. Probably.
