From https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17186591:

A reply to someone saying someone else had a bad experience with Scrum because they did Scrum wrong:

>That sounds ridiculously similar to people hanging on to communism/socialism: "the principles are sound, it just hasn't been implemented as intended". Except, just like communism, Scrum has never and will never be implemented "as intended" because that's contrary to our collective evolutionary gifts, and against a developer's desire to find satisfaction in good craftsmanship. A project management methodology building on utopian altruistic ideals and delusions wrt people's motives is just propaganda.

Couldn't have said it better myself.
