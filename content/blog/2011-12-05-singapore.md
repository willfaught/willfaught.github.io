I got laid over in Singapore on my way from Hong Kong to Vietnam. The passengers were delayed boarding the plane because there was a problem with a smoke detector. The delay caused me to miss my connecting flight in Singapore. The airline, Jetstar, put me up in a decent hotel (Riverview) for the night and paid for the taxis and meals. As you might guess, the hotel was on the shore of a small river, alongside several other large hotels. The buildings were lit in interesting and attractive ways, and a nearby bridge had a cool wavy roof with a blue light running underneath it over the walkway. I ate dinner and strolled around the river area with a beer in hand. It was nice to have a room to myself for once. I took advantage of the extra privacy and space. The room's power was turned on by inserting my door key into the wall. It took a few minutes to figure this out. I made it back to the airport the next morning with no problems. Apparently it had been raining recently, but the weather had brightened that morning, and the sun was out and the sky was blue. The drive to the airport was about 45 minutes, ample time to take in some of the passing scenery. The city is beautiful, clean, and lush. Trees are planted at regular intervals seemingly everywhere. Soon I was on my way to Vietnam.
