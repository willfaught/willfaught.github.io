title: 'Japan: Wednesday Night Lights'

*For Wednesday, October 26, 2011* **Tokyo** The drinking from the night before had overwhelmed me, so I spent most of the morning waking up, cleaning up, and getting stabilized. I needed more cash (a common problem in Tokyo, I was to learn) and something to put in my stomach, so I walked to the nearest 7-11 (all 7-11s have ATMs that accept foreign cards and are open 24 hours per day), withdrew some cash, and bought a sandwich for the road. The sandwich was surprisingly good. (Competition between convenience stores is fierce in Tokyo, so the food quality tends to be good.) I rode the subway to see the [Imperial Palace](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls;=en&q;=tokyo+Imperial+Palace&oe;=UTF-8&um;=1&ie;=UTF-8&hl;=en&tbm;=isch&source;=og&sa;=N&tab;=wi&biw;=1366&bih;=690&sei;=%20pVqtTputNcjzmAW5u-T3Dg). Much of the original palace compound was destroyed in the past, so there are only a few guardhouses and walls to see, aside from the contemporary palace. From there, I walked toward the Ginza district and entered the [Tokyo International Forum](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls;=en&q;=Tokyo+International+Forum&oe;=UTF-8&um;=1&ie;=UTF-8&hl;=en&tbm;=isch&source;=og&sa;=N&tab;=wi&biw;=1366&bih;=690&sei;=%20blutTvHnJOTFmQWn76HWDg) to see its interesting architecture. By then it had turned dark. I walked to the nearby streets of [Ginza](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls;=en&q;=Tokyo+International+Forum&oe;=UTF-8&um;=1&ie;=UTF-8&hl;=en&tbm;=isch&source;=og&sa;=N&tab;=wi&biw;=1366&bih;=690&sei;=%20blutTvHnJOTFmQWn76HWDg#um=1&hl;=en&client;=safari&rls;=en&tbm;=isch&sa;=1&q;=ginza&pbx;=1&oq;=ginza&aq;=f&aqi;=g10&aql;=1&gs;_sm=e&gs;_upl=68694l69126l0l69351l5l4l0l0l0l0l202l717l0.3.1l4l0&bav;=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&fp;=e85638aef1ce869b&biw;=1366&bih;=690) to see the amazing streets lit up like daylight and filled with high-end shops and restaurants. Some buildings have interesting light animations on their walls and windows. Then I rode the subway to [Shibuya](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls;=en&q;=Shibuya&oe;=UTF-8&um;=1&ie;=UTF-8&hl;=en&tbm;=isch&source;=og&sa;=N&tab;=wi&biw;=1366&bih;=690&sei;=%20KFytTtyyEeXdmAXsvv2CDw), a young and hip part of the city where the lights and sounds and crowds again astound the senses. According to a guidebook I read, this intersection crossing was made famous to the western world by the film [Lost in Translation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_in_Translation_(film)) (of which I'm a big fan). I ate [nigiri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushi#Nigirizushi) standing up in Shibuya. It turns out that the [roll sushi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushi#Western-style_sushi) Americans are used to is an invention by Japanese chefs to adapt real sushi to American palates. I still haven't seen a roll in a restaurant. I returned to the hostel and asked if I could stay longer, since I liked the place, but had only booked for a couple nights initially. They didn't have room, so I booked a couple nights at a cheaper hostel. I went to bed at midnight, my feet feeling tired. I had seen a lot that day.
