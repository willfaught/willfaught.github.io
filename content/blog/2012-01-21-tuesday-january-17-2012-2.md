Beach day! Slept in until 9:30 a.m. Showered and got ready. The hostel bathrooms were disgusting, so it took me about an hour to finish. Called Tess. Got lunch. Headed to the beach with a used copy of Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson that I had picked up the night before. Swam in the surf and baked in the sand and read about buried treasure all afternoon until the light fell and it felt time to leave. Met a couple more people at the hostel. Listened to one girl, Xin, talk about a boat tour of the Angthong Marine Park islands that she had done that day. I decided to do it too and booked a ticket that night. I had to get up early for the island tour, so I got ready for bed around 11 p.m.
