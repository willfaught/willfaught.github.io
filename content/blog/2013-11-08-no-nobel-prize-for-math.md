From http://www.snopes.com/science/nobel.asp:

I first heard this story from Dr. Vakalis during a computer science lecture at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo. He's an excellent and funny story teller, and I really enjoyed this one, so I was disappointed to find out that it's probably not true. Too bad!
