Rode the BTS and MRT to Hua Lamphong station to arrange transportation to Ko Samui. Bought a sleeper bus ticket to Surat Thani that would depart at 7 PM on Sunday and a ferry ticket from Surat Thani to Ko Samui. The bus company would get me from the bus station to the ferry pier. Then I rode the MRT and BTS to Mo Chit station and explored the JJ weekend market for several hours. This thing is enormous. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of stalls, selling anything you can think of. I bought a new day pack. I returned to my hostel by the BTS and ate two orders of pad thai for dinner at the small night market on Sukhumvit Soi 38, near my hostel. I showered and then rode the BTS to Chit Lom station to meet my friend Pla to go to a club with On, a mutual friend, and a few of their friends. I didn't know there was a dress code, so I had to return to my hostel to change into pants and shoes. When I again arrived at Chit Lom station, Pla said her friends had changed clubs. We then went to the BTS station for my hostel and then took a taxi the rest of the way. There were a couple bands at the club playing Thai music. I had no idea what the singers were singing, but I liked the tunes. I returned to my hostel at about 2:30 AM.
