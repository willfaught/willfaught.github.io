title: Binary tree sequentializations as identities
---

>The trace of a traversal [of a binary tree] is called a sequentialization of the tree. No one sequentialisation according to pre-, in- or post-order describes the underlying tree uniquely, but any combination of two types of sequentialisation does. Any two sequentializations of a binary tree can uniquely identify it, so you can directly compare those of any two binary trees to determine whether their structure and values are equal.
