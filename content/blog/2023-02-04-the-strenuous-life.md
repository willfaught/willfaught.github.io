[Theodore Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt) on [April 10, 1899](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strenuous_Life):

>I wish to preach, not the doctrine of ignoble ease, but the doctrine of the strenuous life, the life of toil and effort, of labor and strife; to preach that highest form of success which comes, not to the man who desires mere easy peace, but to the man who does not shrink from danger, from hardship, or from bitter toil, and who out of these wins the splendid ultimate triumph.
