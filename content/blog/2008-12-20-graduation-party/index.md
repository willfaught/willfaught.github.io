title: Graduation Party
---

My parents threw me a graduation party while I was home for Thanksgiving. It was either do it then or never. They invited lots of family friends in the area, and I invited Heather. My parents assembled lots of tasty hors d'oeuvres and wines and played music and we all stood and sat and chatted and snacked and sipped away the evening. There must have been twenty people there at one point. There were a few people there I hadn't seen in a long time, and it was the first time I think I've ever seen all of our neighbors in our house at once. I wish I had taken pictures, but I was caught up in it all. I didn't even think about getting something to eat until most people had left and the food was almost gone. It was quite a success and very fun.
