title: 'Japan: Japanese Pancakes — Sort Of'

*For Monday, October 31, 2011*

**Tokyo**

Still being sick, I let myself sleep in again. The weather was still gray and dreary, so again I decided to stay inside and take it easy. I called Tess at 2 p.m. and caught up with her. In the evening, I went out to eat [okonomiyaki](https://www.google.com/search?q=okonomiyaki) — kind of like a Japanese pancake — delicious! — for dinner with Chris and Billy (both from Australia), Damian and Aliena (both from Canada), and Angelica and Felix (both from Sweden).
