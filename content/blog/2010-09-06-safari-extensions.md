title: Safari Extensions

Despite wanting Firefox-like extensions for Safari, I only just tried [Safari extensions](http://extensions.apple.com/). *Gentle Status Bar* and *Middle-Click AutoScroll* add Chrome-like behavior. *AdBlock* is a necessity for any clean experience. *Delicous*, *Instapaper*, and *Add To Google Reader* are invaluable when finding things to go back to. *Add To Amazon Wish List* is a good idea, but I sense it's naively implemented.
