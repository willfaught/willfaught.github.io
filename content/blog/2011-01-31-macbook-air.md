I think the next home computer setup I'll have will be a MacBook Air combined with a wireless keyboard and mouse and an Apple 27" display. I like the idea of being able to take my whole digital presence on the go with me, but be able to plug in for some extra screen space if I need it. Having a dedicated computer for the desktop seems like overkill these days.
