Apparently, I've been tying my shoes incorrectly all my life. I've been tying the granny knot, which comes untied easily and tends to be oriented toe-to-heel instead of side-to-side. I tie my shoelaces right over left, then right loop over left loop. Fortunately, it's easy to correct: reverse the first step. For me, I have to do left over right, then right loop over left loop. Do they take away your kindergarten diploma for this?
