I just rewatched Evolver. I saw it once long ago, in high school. Somehow, I remember a dumb quotation from it, where a scientist tried to give a voice command to a killer robot to shut it down: "Alpha command sequence! Shutdown! Phoenix eight! Delete! Delete!" I was curious whether I actually remembered it correctly. Turns out I did. Of all things, what a dorky thing to remember!
