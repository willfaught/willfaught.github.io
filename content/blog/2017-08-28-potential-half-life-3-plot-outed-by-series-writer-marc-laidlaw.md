title: Potential Half-Life 3 plot outed by series writer Marc Laidlaw
---

From https://arstechnica.com/?p=1153463:

>Half-Life 3, gaming's greatest unicorn, may finally be with usâ€”albeit in text form. Marc Laidlaw, the now retired lead writer of the Half-Life series, has published what appears to be a summary of the plot of Half-Life 3, or Half-Life 2: Episode 3, entitled "Epistle 3." This pretty much clinches it for me that it isn't being worked on. Thanks to Mark Laidlaw for giving us fans some kind of closure.
