Ate an American breakfast at a restaurant across the street. Rode the minibus to the Ko Phuket airport and arrived at 1:30 PM. Ate lunch at Burger King and then had four or so hours to kill. Drank some beers in a bar to use their free wifi. Flew to Chiang Mai at about 7:30 PM and arrived at about 9:30 PM. Rode a taxi to my hostel, A Little Bird Guesthouse, in the old quarter of the city. Walked around the nearby streets a little, then returned and went to bed.
