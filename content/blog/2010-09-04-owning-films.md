title: Owning Films
---

I was just looking at my film collection and realized that I never want to own another film. I'll eventually sell off most of them, except for my favorites that I can watch a hundred times and still love. If I want to watch a film, I can just queue it on Netflix and have it within days. If I have the urge to watch a film immediately, I can rent it on iTunes or Amazon for just a few dollars and start watching it immediately. Either way, I save money. Thank you, Internet.

We seem to be digitizing and transmitting media more and more. Ideally, none of my media would occupy any physical space and would be available on demand anywhere. Apple TV, Amazon Kindle, iPad, and iPhone together seem to offer a pretty comprehensive way to do this.
