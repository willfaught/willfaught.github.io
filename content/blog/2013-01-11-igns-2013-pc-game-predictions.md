title: IGN's 2013 PC Game Predictions
---

>Half-Life 3 will be announced as a multiplatform title as soon as Sony and Microsoft unveil their next-generation hardware plans.

This sounds plausible. Concurrent launch windows would be perfect for a multi-platform release, and they've already done a few with the Orange Box and Left 4 Dead games.

I've been awaiting this game for years.

>Bethesda Game Studios' next role-playing game will be announced at E3 2013 and it'll be Fallout 4.

Let me guess: same feel and mechanics as Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Been there, done that. Changing the plot and re-skinning everything doesn't count as a new *game*. There are multiple Monopoly *themes*, but nobody buys more than one, and nobody thinks of them as different games. Pass.
