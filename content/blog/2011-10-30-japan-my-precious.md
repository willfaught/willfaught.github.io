**Tokyo**

I went to [Harajuku](https://www.google.com/search?q=harajuku), the young fashion center of Tokyo, to see the bizarre outfits and explore the clothing shops. I ate [udon](https://www.google.com/search?q=udon) for the first time for lunch. I went to the Apple store in Shibuya and bought a [128 GB 11" MacBook Air](https://www.apple.com/macbookair/). I couldn't stand not having my own computer environment anymore. I had been having trouble finding the time or opportunity to blog about my experiences. I needed a way to back up my pictures in case I lost my camera. I wanted to upgrade my iPhone's operating system to version 5, which unfortunately had been released *after* I left home. I knew exactly what I wanted, and the staff there were great getting me all set up. Thanks to the great service [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), my entire digital environment is accessible worldwide: music, documents, pictures, videos, anything I want accessible. I just have to wait for it all to download. From this point on, everything I blogged was done with my new precious. With my new laptop secure in my daypack, I rode the subway to [Shinjuku](https://www.google.com/search?q=shinjuku) and explored the high-rise government buildings and brightly-signed streets of the [Kabukicho](https://www.google.com/search?q=kabukicho) red light district. From there, I rode the subway to [Ikebukuro](https://www.google.com/search?q=ikebukuro) and sought out [Sunshine City](https://www.google.com/search?q=ikebukuro+sunshine+city). After an hour of searching, my feet were tired, and my throat felt sore, so I gave up and returned home. Just before bed, I researched some elements of Japanese culture that I wanted to experience, like a [Japanese tea ceremony](https://www.google.com/search?q=japanese+tea+ceremony), [kabuki theater](https://www.google.com/search?q=kabuki), [bunraku puppetry](https://www.google.com/search?q=bunraku), and [sumo wrestling](https://www.google.com/search?q=sumo+wrestling).
