If invalid, informal, and injustice are the opposites of valid, formal, and justice, then why does [inflammable](https://dictionary.reference.com/browse/inflammable) mean the same as flammable? Since English is my first language, I obviously prefer it to any other language, but damn, English sucks. One thing I've always appreciated about Spanish is that you can look at any word and know immediately how to pronounce it correctly.
