I was walking out of class on Tuesday and it just died. The strap of my right flip flop broke off. So I had to walk all over campus with one shoe to do my other errands. I asked in the Health Center if they had any plastic booty-thingies for feet and the X-ray technician jumped on it and fixed it for me. Such service! Thank you, Dorothy the Technician, from the bottom of my heart!
