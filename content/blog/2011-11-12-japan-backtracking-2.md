*For Sunday, November 6, 2011* **Hiroshima** Chris (from Australia) and I rode the Shinkansen train to Tokyo. It took five hours altogether. We had to sit apart, so I mostly listened to podcasts to pass the time. It was pleasant just to sit there and watch the landscape slide past. **Tokyo** At the JR station, Chris and I parted ways. He was returning home, having spent two weeks in Japan for vacation. I rode the metro to Ueno station and then transferred to the Ueno Keisei station, then rode the Keisei train to Narita. **Narita** I rode a bus from the Narita airport terminal out into the middle of nowhere and then walked ten minutes in the dark to my hostel, [Narita Airport Hostel](http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Narita-Airport-Hostel/Narita-Airport/28878). I checked in, then called home using Skype. I chatted with my dad for a half hour or so, then went to sleep.
