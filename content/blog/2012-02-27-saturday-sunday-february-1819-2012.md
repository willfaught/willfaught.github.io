Didn't do much. Again, I felt tired, and mostly remained inside and ate at nearby restaurants. One evening I walked to the Mekong River's edge to see the night market there and watch the local people. Ran into a few more people from the group I was with at the river near Vang Vieng. Met a girl in my hostel that I'd met before at my hostel in Luang Prabang. Feeling the bandaid on my face was a constant reminder of the river, and I think it put me in a bad mood.
