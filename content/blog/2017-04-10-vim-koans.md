From https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/vim-koans/:

>The novice finished aligning two beams and had positioned a nail ready for beating into the wood, but found the hammer was out of reach.
>
>"Would you pass me the hammer, master?"
>
>Master Wq handed the novice a saw.
>
>At once, the novice was enlightened.

So good.
