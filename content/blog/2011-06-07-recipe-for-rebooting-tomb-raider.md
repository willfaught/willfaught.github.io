title: Recipe for Rebooting Tomb Raider

>Sprinkle Some RPG Elements: Tomb Raider will use a base camp system as Lara's home base or hub world. Here she can upgrade and build new gear, as well as purchase new survival skills (although I'm not yet sure what she'll use for currency). From her base camp, she can revisit previous levels to look for items and reach areas previously inaccessible, much like Metroidvania games.

Why does this sound so familiar?

If you find yourself sprinkling RPG elements into your video game, you've run out of good ideas and tacitly admit the core game play isn't compelling enough to carry the narrative as far as you want.

If you're going to take the low road, at least don't make it contrived. Buying upgrades when marooned on a small island with hostile natives? With what? From whom? It doesn't matter, because I don't (and won't) buy it.
