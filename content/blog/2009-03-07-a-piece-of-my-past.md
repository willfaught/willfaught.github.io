+++

This [recliner](https://seattle.craigslist.org/see/fuo/1065167316.html) has been with my family for as long as I can remember. Sadly, I no longer have a place for it and it must go, finally passing from us to parts unknown. I'm sad to see it go. It feels like a piece of my past will be lost. I wish we could all have museums of our lives, so we could keep all the things that mean something to us when we have no where else to put them. I could occasionally visit my museum and take a nap or watch a movie in my recliner for a taste of times past.
