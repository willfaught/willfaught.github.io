title: Neighborhood Thief

I went shopping at the Costco in Seattle for the first time today. They didn't give me any bags or boxes in which to carry my stuff, so I had to carry a few items at a time from my car to my apartment. On my first trip, I put together an armload of provisions, and thought I could add to it a two-pack of Clearasil facial cleanser, but it was too much. I had already closed the trunk, so I set down the two-pack under my rear bumper and pushed it back a couple feet.

I was gone no more than two or three minutes, and returned for my second armload to find the two-pack gone. No one was in sight; it was just gone. I was shocked. I hadn't thought that anyone saw me hide it, nor that a passerby would see it, nor that anyone was likely to pass by in the short period that I would be gone. But I was more shocked that someone would rip off a $10 two-pack of Clearasil facial cleanser.

Really? Clearasil? If you're going to sully your dignity by stealing from a neighbor, I would think you'd do it for something more valuable. I suppose this is a good lesson to learn early; thankfully it didn't cost me more than $10.
