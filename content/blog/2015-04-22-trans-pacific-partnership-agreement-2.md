From https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp:

Electronic Frontier Foundation:

>The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a secretive, multinational trade agreement that threatens to extend restrictive intellectual property (IP) laws across the globe and rewrite international rules on its enforcement. The main problems are two-fold:
>
>(1) Intellectual Property Chapter: Leaked draft texts of the agreement show that the IP chapter would have extensive negative ramifications for usersâ€™ freedom of speech, right to privacy and due process, and hinder peoples' abilities to innovate.
>
>(2) Lack of Transparency: The entire process has shut out multi-stakeholder participation and is shrouded in secrecy.

One can only imagine the awful things that haven't been revealed yet.

If you want to contact your representatives about TPP, EFF has [a handy form for contacting them all at once for you](https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-fast-track-tpp).
