title: 'Why Go Is Not Good :: Will Yager'
---

Will Yager on Golang:

>I like Go. I use it for a number of things (including this blog, at the time of writing). Go is useful. With that said, Go is not a good language. It’s not bad; it’s just not good.
>
>We have to be careful using languages that aren’t good, because if we’re not careful, we might end up stuck using them for the next 20 years.
>
>This is a list of my chief complaints about Go. Some of these are mentioned frequently, and some are rarely discussed.
>
>I’ve also included some comparisons to both Rust and Haskell (which I consider to be good languages). This is to show that all the problems listed here have already been solved.

I completely agree with every point. I’m pleased yet annoyed that he wrote it before I could.
