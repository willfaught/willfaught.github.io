Apple announced a lot of new things on Monday: [their next Mac OS](https://www.apple.com/macosx/), [their next iOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios5/), and [their new cloud service](https://www.apple.com/icloud/). I'm really excited about iOS and iCloud. The new feature I like the best is that iOS devices no longer need to synchronize with a computer. This necessitated a lot of additional functionality in the built-in apps and settings to make iOS self-sufficient. It really is the post-PC era! I can't wait to get them all.
