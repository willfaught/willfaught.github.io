From https://medium.com/@betable/things-i-learned-at-jsconf-eu-2015-cb218fa054fe:

Thor Spieker, fellow Betable engineer, on his experience at JSConf 2015:

>First off, let me start by saying that this was my first conference ever, and also that I am not actually a front-end JavaScript developer. Day to day, I spend my time building back-end micro-services in GO for Betable, an online gambling platform. I only dabble in JavaScript when I need to work on our externally facing API, which is written in Node.js. Needless to say, I was a little intimidated going to an all-JavaScript conference where every single person there was probably a much better JavaScript developer than I currently am.

It sounds like an amazing event.
