After Dalat and the six-day Easy Rider motorbike ride with Hien, I went to Hoi An. Hien dropped me off at one side of Hoi An and we parted ways. Stayed in a cheap hotel for $9 per night for several days. Browsed several shops and bought five paper lanterns in assorted colors, a dirty metal gong, a couple dirty coins, a few small paintings on scraps of paper, a marble tea box, and a marble candle box. I shipped them home the long way. Found a really nice, good, and cheap restaurant on the edge of town. Ate at a couple restaurants along the river. Did a tour of the My Son ruins an hour outside of town. Wanted to rent a motorbike and ride to the nearby Marble Mountains, but the timing didn't work out. Hoi An's shops, streets, and riversides are decorated with lit lanterns at night, and at night people buy lit candles in paper boats and set them afloat on the river. People go to the riversides at night and stroll and shop and snack and listen to Vietnamese music. It was the most pleasant place I experienced in Vietnam.
