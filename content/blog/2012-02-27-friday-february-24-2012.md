Called Tess to plan my flight to Seattle. Ate lunch at my hostel. Walked to a nearby ATM. Rode a motorbike taxi to the S-21 museum where thousands were detained and tortured for confessions by the Khmer Rouge. Afterward, rode a motorbike taxi to the killing fields just outside of town where thousands were murdered. It was so very sad. Rode a motorbike taxi back to my hostel. Bought a flight ticket to Taipei for the next day and booked a hostel I'd stayed at before, Chocolate Box. Ate dinner at my hostel and played on my computer.
