title: Johnson Rod Repair
---

I took my car into a Toyota dealership a couple weeks ago to have my left headlight's wiring replaced and my AC recharged. In their inspection, they found many other things that needed fixing, some large, some small, and quoted me a $4,000 price to do it all. I've never dealt with car repairs before (having a father who's the best mechanic around), so I called my dad to see if they were overcharging. It turns out they were overselling me by as much as 200-300% for some things, so I took my car to a small repair shop in Seattle to have the major things repaired for more reasonable prices.
