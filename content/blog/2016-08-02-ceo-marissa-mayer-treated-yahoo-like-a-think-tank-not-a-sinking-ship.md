title: CEO Marissa Mayer Treated Yahoo Like A Think Tank, Not A Sinking Ship

From http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/08/01/488246171/ceo-marissa-mayer-treated-yahoo-like-a-think-tank-not-a-sinking-ship?sc=17&f=1001:

I can't decide who comes out of this looking worse: Mayer, who did nothing substantial, or the board that paid her a bonus for it.
