title: Apple's Secret Plan To Boost IPhone Sales Is Working

>For 24 relatively low monthly payments—anywhere from $32.41 to $44.91—customers get AppleCare+ phone support/damage insurance (a $11/month value) and the option to trade up to an iPhone 7 (or whatever it’s called) a year from now.

It's not so much a lease as a financed purchase. After 24 months, you've fully paid for the iPhone and the AppleCare+ warranty. If you choose to upgrade after a year, you've only paid for half of the iPhone, and its value has only dropped by about half, so that's a wash.

The upshot of the Apple purchase program is that when you upgrade after a year, the AppleCare+ resets and applies for 2 years to the new phone, so you get that extra year of coverage for free. However, you'll only enjoy that extra year when you *stop* the Apple purchase plan, such that you're no longer paying Apple, but you're still enjoying that extra year of AppleCare+.
