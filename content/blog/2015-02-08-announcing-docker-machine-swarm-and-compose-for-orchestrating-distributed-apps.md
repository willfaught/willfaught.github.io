title: Announcing Docker Machine, Swarm, And Compose For Orchestrating Distributed
  Apps
---

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) seems like a really cool idea. I'd never heard of Linux control groups before learning about Docker. I'm interested to know how it works exactly, and why a Docker "runtime" is needed. The last company I worked for built VM images with Vagrant, and while this was pretty cool, they were huge and onerous and the tools for creating and deploying them were clunky and difficult to automate. These lightweight containers seem like a much better solution. It seems like there's quite a bit of buzz and perhaps momentum behind it. Docker Machine, Swarm, and Compose are great additions to the mix. It's interesting that Docker is written in Golang. I've been using Golang a lot at work, and like it a lot. I'm always curious to see how others are using it.
