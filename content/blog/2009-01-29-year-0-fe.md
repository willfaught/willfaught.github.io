That's F.E. for Furniture Era, the period in which I finally have something to sit and eat on. It's been a long time coming. I recently went to the closest Ashley Furniture store and furnishedÂ almost my entire apartment: couch, love seat, chair, ottoman, end tables, coffee table, dining table, chairs, bed frame, dresser, and night stand. It's all going to be delivered tomorrow morning. I can't wait! I hope nothing is delivered damaged or otherwise has to be returned. I want to sit on all of it now. Yes, even the night stand. I'll post some pictures when I get a chance.
