title: LOTR Extended
---

I just finished watching the extended versions of the Lord Of The Rings films. I've had these versions for several years now, and I thought I'd seen them all, but watching them now, so many of the extended scenes felt new to me. Strange. I can't decide if it's because I forgot them, or because I hadn't watched them yet, which would be quite an oversight for a fan like me. I've got to read those books again.
