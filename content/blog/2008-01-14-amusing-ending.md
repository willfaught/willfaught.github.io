[James Koman](https://www.mustangdaily.net/user/index.cfm?event=displayAuthorProfile&authorid=2668287) recently wrote an opinion article in the [Mustang Daily](https://www.mustangdaily.net/), the student newspaper of Cal Poly, entitled [*Why I hate white people*](https://media.www.mustangdaily.net/media/storage/paper860/news/2008/01/10/Columns/Why-I.Hate.White.People-3148711-page2.shtml). The article contains very racist and ignorant thoughts about white people, in case you couldn't tell from the title. The newspaper was flooded with protesting letters to the editor in the following days. I just read the article and found the last sentence amusing, which is ironic since the rest of the article wasn't:

>White folks always try to rationalize their racial status by stating "I'm half-Italian, half-Norwegian," or "I'm British," or "I'm albino," but they're just trying to avoid the dreaded truth: they are white people. Not me though, I'm Irish-Polish-Czech. I hope this column forces you and your people to look inward and realize that your egotistic nature, fast-food diet and overall smaller brain size are a drain on this great nation and the dreams of our white Founding Fathers. Thank you for your time.

>James Koman is a biology junior and a Mustang Daily humor columnist.

I don't know how that guy can show his face on campus again.
