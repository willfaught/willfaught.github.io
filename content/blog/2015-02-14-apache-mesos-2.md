title: "Apache Mesos"

From http://mesos.apache.org:

>Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and run effectively.
>
>Mesos is built using the same principles as the Linux kernel, only at a different level of abstraction. The Mesos kernel runs on every machine and provides applications (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Elastic Search) with APIâ€™s for resource management and scheduling across entire datacenter and cloud environments.

Another cool cluster management idea. It even integrates Kubernetes.

There's an [enterprise version](https://mesosphere.com) as well.
