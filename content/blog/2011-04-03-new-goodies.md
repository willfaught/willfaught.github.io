I recently bought a MacBook Air (13", 256 GB SSD, 4 GB RAM, 2.13 GHz) and a Canon S95. My prior digital camera was several years old and was showing its age. It was very difficult to get low-light shots to turn out right, and most of my pictures were low-light. The S95 is a godsend. I've only tried it out a little bit in my apartment so far, but even using the flash in near darkness (in my bathroom), the pictures look like they were taken with all the lights on. Well done, Canon! The thinness of the 13" MacBook Air is quite astonishing. It's so light in your hands, so wafer thin. The battery life is amazing compared to the three hours of my prior laptop, a MacBook from several years ago that has served me faithfully all this time. I bought the Air because I see myself living a more unpredictable life in the near future, so I see it becoming my main computer soon. I think a 27" Apple display and wireless keyboard and mouse would go well with it. It having an SSD, I immediately turned on FileVault, since you can't shred a file system on them. So far I'm loving them both!
