title: "Apple bug: Frozen Mail share sheet"
---

Tried to share a 3 MB PDF with the Apple Mail share sheet from the Backblaze app and the sheet froze. I sent it to the iBooks app and then tried to email it again, and again it froze. Finally, I sent it to Dropbox and emailed a link to the file there.
