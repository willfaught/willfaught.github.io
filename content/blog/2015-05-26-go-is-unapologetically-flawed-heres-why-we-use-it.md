title: Go Is Unapologetically Flawed, Here's Why We Use It
---

A critique of the Golang language, tools, creators, and community by Tyler Treat:

>I'm cautiously optimistic about Go's future. I don't consider myself a hater, I consider myself a hopeful. As it continues to gain a critical mass, I'm hopeful that the language will continue to improve but fearful of its relentless dogma. Go needs to let go of this attitude of "you don't need that” or "it's too complicated” or "programmers won't know how to use it.” It's toxic. It's not all that different from your users requesting features after you release a product and telling those users they aren't smart enough to use them. It's not on your users, it's on you to make the UX good.

>A language can have considerable depth while still retaining its simplicity. I wish this were the ideal Go embraced, not one of negativity, of pessimism, of "no.” The question is not how can we protect developers from themselves, it's how can we make them more productive? How can we enable them to solve problems? But just because people are solving problems with Go today does not mean we can't do better. There is always room for improvement. There is never room for complacency.

So many great points and examples. This struck a chord.
