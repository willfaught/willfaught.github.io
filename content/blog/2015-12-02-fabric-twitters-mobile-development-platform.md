title: 'Fabric: Twitter''s Mobile Development Platform'
---

>Since the birth of mobile apps, we’ve witnessed an explosion of mobile development tools. Today, many of these tools still require countless hours on the developer’s part to implement: creating different accounts, configuring the SDKs, among others. With Fabric, you’ll never have to worry about tedious configurations or juggling different accounts. We let you get right into coding and building the next big app. Interesting. I would consider using this if I knew how to make apps.
