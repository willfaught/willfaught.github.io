>Dear Mr. Faught,
>
>Thank you for contacting AARP about our membership solicitations. Please accept our apology for any aggravation these mailings may have caused.  It's my pleasure to honor your request.
>
>I've removed your name from our solicitation lists, and regret that mailings prepared before today's date cannot be recalled.  It will take approximately 4-6 weeks for this process to take full effect. If you should receive solicitations after that time, please call us toll-free at 1-888-OUR-AARP (1-888-687-2277) and a Member Service Associate will be happy to assist you. Be sure to have the mailing available when you call, as each notice has specific codes that will help us suppress your name and address more effectively.

>Mr. Faught, I hope this information is helpful.  If I can assist you further, please do not hesitate to contact me.

>The last email did not address my question.  I would like to know from whom AARP learned the name and address used to send me mail.  Clearly, it came from a third party, and I would like to know who it was so I can stop doing business with them.

>Hello? My question has not been answered. See below.

>Dear Mr. Faught:
>
>Thank you for contacting us.  Please accept our apology for the AARP membership invitation you received in the mail.

>The names for membership solicitation come from a variety of mailing lists.  AARP screens its lists carefully and requests that list suppliers provide only names of people age 50 and older.  However, the information on some lists may be inaccurate.  Your name may have also appeared on a special interest mailing list because you enjoy a particular hobby or pastime.  AARP looks at age as well as special interests to help identify prospective members.

>My point is that my information should not have been available to AARP at all, regardless of how relevant its services are to me.  I want to know who it was that gave AARP my contact information, so that I can determine how THEY got my information.
>
>Is someone there going to tell me how AARP got my information, or not?

>Thank you for contacting AARP.  ***Please accept our condolences on the loss of your loved one as well as our apology for the solicitations you received in your name*** [emphasis mine]***.*** We are sorry we did not answer you previous request.

The only useful information I got out of them was the link to the [Direct Marketing Assocation opt-out registration](https://preference.the-dma.org/cgi/ddnc.php).
