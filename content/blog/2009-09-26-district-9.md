title: District 9

Just saw District 9 with Brian and Shay. It was great to see a sci-fi movie in the theaters (and I don't mean the kind of sci-fi that Transformers is). Although there wasn't much science in the movie. Still, fun to see aliens, and the parallels between how the humans treat the aliens and South Africa's racial history were interesting to see. There were a few plot holes, I think, but it was still fun to watch. I got creeped out by the mutation and mutilation scenes. Ugh. I was hoping they'd show the guy being turned back again at the end, but oh well. The main character (I don't even remember his name, it was a foreign one) reminded me of the British TV show The Office's version of Michael Scott before he was told there was a way to save himself. All in all, good stuff. I'd see it again sometime.
