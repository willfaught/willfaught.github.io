I was anchoring my bookcase to the wall when I heard these strange sounds coming from behind me. I walked a little toward the sounds, trying to pinpoint their source. I looked up at the window, saw streaks and dots, and realized that it was raining. I hadn't realized it until then, but I had never heard the rain in my apartment before. Strange, since I live in Seattle.
