I love the character Auntie Muriel in the book *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*. She uses her age like some kind of free pass that entitles her to boss those younger than her (everyone) around. To paraphrase, "Give me your chair, I'm one hundred and seven years old." Awesome! It's like everyone is obligated to be her bitch.

There should be more age-based benefits. I would want cuts in line. We could all wear numbers ranking our seniority in the nation to help sort ourselves in line.

What older-than-thou privilege would you want? Extra credit if you know from where I got the title.
