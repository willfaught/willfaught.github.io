From http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2425755,00.asp:

I never get extended warranties for phones or computers. I figure if there’s ever a problem where I need it, then I’ll wish I had it, and if it’s painful enough, I can get it then, but until then, that’s money in the bank. It’s been years. Extended warranties are a scam unless you have special circumstances, like you’re a klutz.
