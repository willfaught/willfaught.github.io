title: Uncharted 3 multiplayer beta
---

The problem is that too much stuff is thrown into the mix. Everyone has two weapons, a grenade, power ups, boosters, enhancements, experience points, dollars, and all this other random shit that results in a confusing maelstrom that you can only survive for a minute or two at a time. I don't like dying so often. It's a jarring experience. I make a plan, and before I can get a quarter way through it, I end up getting shot in the head through a wall by some guy twenty yards away. WTF. It's just so *frantic*. I don't like it. Give me the multiplayer of GoldenEye any day.
