I really like the song "Poker Face" by Lady Gaga. The sound grew on me, and now I love it. I especially enjoy the lyrics. The wording is colorful and rich and paints vivid pictures using few words. It's delightfully dark. Here's an excerpt:

>I want to hold them like they do in Texas plays
>Fold them, let them hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me (I love it)
>Luck and intuition play the cards with spades to start
>And after he’s been hooked I’ll play the one that’s on his heart

I love the way her voice drops low for "I love it." The delivery is a driving, robotic rhythm that reinforces her emotional distance and subtle perversion. It's fantastic. You can listen to it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ5uCfwK6qw).
