*For Tuesday, November 1, 2011* **Tokyo** I did laundry in the morning, then rode the [Shinkansen](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls;=en&q;=shinkansen&oe;=UTF-8&um;=1&ie;=UTF-8&hl;=en&tbm;=isch&source;=og&sa;=N&tab;=wi&biw;=1366&bih;=690&sei;=%20T1a1TtXMKYvymAXLkdHSAw) train with Chris (from Australia) to [Kyoto](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client;=safari&rls;=en&q;=kyoto&gs;_sm=e&gs;_upl=26465l27215l0l27483l5l4l0l0l0l0l162l558l1.3l4l0&bav;=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&biw;=1366&bih;=690&um;=1&ie;=UTF-8&tbm;=isch&source;=og&sa;=N&tab;=wi). **Kyoto** Chris and I checked into our hostel, [Backpackers Hostel K's House Kyoto](http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Backpackers-Hostel-K-s-House-Kyoto/Kyoto/5536?sc_sau=rt), then headed to the adjacent bar for a couple beers. I went back to my room to get something and met Mike (from the U.S.) and asked him to join Chris and I in the bar. I went back to the bar and researched what I wanted to see in Kyoto. Mike and Marion (from France) joined us and we chatted for a while over beers. The hostel threw a party with free sushi and snacks to celebrate their eighth anniversary. Afterward, they played bingo and gave away prizes. We were still hungry, so we walked a few blocks away and found a yakitori restaurant, where Mike — who had been teaching English in Japan for a year — ordered skewers of meat and beer for us. Then we walked back to the hostel and stopped at a 7-11 on the way to buy a beer for the road (there are no open container laws in Japan). We returned to the hostel and hung out in the common room for a few minutes before heading off for bed.
