title: I Would Want To Stay
---

During a speech made by President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at the United Nations, [in which he called Israel a racist nation](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/world/21geneva.html?scp=4&sq=israel%20racist&st=cse), several national representatives walked out of the audience in protest. I imagined myself there, and feeling compelled to walk out to symbolize my repudiation of what was being said. However, I'd actually want to hear the rest of the speech. Not because I agree with what was said, but you have to admit, it really grabs your attention: a whole countryâ€”racist! I'd walk out, but then I'd listen to the rest in another room. It's silly that I'd have to leave when I really wanted to stay. Can't one just sit and listen to crazy things in peace?
