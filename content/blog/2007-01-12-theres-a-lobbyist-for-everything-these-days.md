title: There's A Lobbyist For Everything These Days
---

The average height of Dutch men and women has [increased so dramatically in the past century](https://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/040405fa_fact?040405fa_fact) that being too tall for a standard-height ceiling or a standard-length bed has become a common problem. So problematic, in fact, that there is a *tall person organization* that lobbies on behalf of tall people for more head room:

>The Netherlands, as any European can tell you, has become a land of giants. In a century’s time, the Dutch have gone from being among the smallest people in Europe to the largest in the world. The men now average six feet one&mdash;seven inches taller than in van Gogh’s day&mdash;and the women five feet eight. The national organization of tall people, Klub Lange Mensen, has considerable lobbying power. From Rotterdam to Eindhoven, ceilings have had to be lifted, furniture redesigned, lintels raised to keep foreheads from smacking them. Many hotels now offer twenty-centimetre bed extensions, and ambulances on occasion must keep their back doors open, to allow for patients’ legs. “We will not go through the ceiling,” the pediatrician Hans van Wieringen assured me, after summarizing national height surveys that he had coördinated. “But it is possible that we will grow another ten centimetres.”

What I want to know is where is my college student lobbyist?
