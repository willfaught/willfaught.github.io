title: What I learnt from building 3 high traffic web applications on an embedded
  key value store.
---

From https://hackernoon.com/what-i-learnt-from-building-3-high-traffic-web-applications-on-an-embedded-key-value-store-68d47249774f:

Anthony Alaribe:

>Firstly, a NoSQL key value store is fast, much faster than a comparable relational database. Its speed comes from its simplicity. A key value database stores a data record using one primary key. The key means the record is uniquely identifiable, and can be directly accessed. Other than this, itâ€™s up to the developer to architect any more complexity in accessing data.
