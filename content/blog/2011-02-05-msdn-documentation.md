title: MSDN documentation
---

This is the most useless documentation I've ever seen. Every Boolean property "gets a value that indicates" something. Inherited methods are mixed with the others. You have to drill down one page to see the list of overrides for a method name. I've seen some class docs explain what they do by restating the class name in sentence form. I pine for the Javadocs of yore.
