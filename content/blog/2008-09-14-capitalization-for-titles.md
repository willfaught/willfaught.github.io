title: Capitalization For Titles
---

Every word in a title should be capitalized. It's an acceptable form of capitalization and it's super easy to remember. I don't understand why most people don't do it that way. Otherwise you have to memorize all these exceptions for which words can and can't be capitalized. Who can remember all of that? What about "in," "to," or "on?" It's just not obvious.

It's like putting a comma after the second-to-last item in a list. I remember being told in school that you can omit the comma in some situations, but not others, or you could always put it there and it would always be correct. I stopped listening after that, decided to just always put it there, and kept playing Oregon Trail or whatever. Easy.
