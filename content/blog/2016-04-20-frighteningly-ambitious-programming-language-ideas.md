title: Frighteningly Ambitious Programming Language Ideas

From http://evincarofautumn.blogspot.com/2012/04/frighteningly-ambitious-programming.html:

Jon Purdy:

>Furthermore, 1D languages require jumps for flow control, but since any graph can be embedded in three dimensions, languages of three or more dimensions can be written jump-free. An easy way to do this is to allow changing the direction of the instruction pointer rather than its position.

Blew my mind.
