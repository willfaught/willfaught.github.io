Dave Cheney:

>In my mind, of all the possible candidates that Go has removed, it is the removal of threads that will be its most profound contribution.

>This is not to say that Go programs do not use threads, any more than you can say structured programs are not compiled into branch and jump instructions.

>But Go programmers no longer have to concern themselves with thread management, or as Uncle Bob would say, Go programmers are restricted from directly controlling the thread their code runs on.

Really insightful. His points about code formatting and interfaces are spot-on too.
