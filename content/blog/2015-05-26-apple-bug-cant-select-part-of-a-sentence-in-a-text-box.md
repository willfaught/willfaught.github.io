title: 'Apple Bug: Can''t Select Part Of A Sentence In A Text Box'
---

I typed this into the Tumblr app:

><p>So many great points and examples. This struck a chord.</p>

I couldn't select just "So many great points and examples. This struck a chord." If I tried, it selected the whole paragraph. But leaving the ending period out of the selection works. No kind of cursor or selection boundary fiddling worked.
