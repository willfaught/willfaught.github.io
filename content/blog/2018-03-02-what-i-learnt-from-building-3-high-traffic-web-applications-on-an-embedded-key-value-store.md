title: What I Learnt From Building 3 High Traffic Web Applications On An Embedded

Anthony Alaribe:

>Firstly, a NoSQL key value store is fast, much faster than a comparable relational database. Its speed comes from its simplicity. A key value database stores a data record using one primary key. The key means the record is uniquely identifiable, and can be directly accessed. Other than this, itâ€™s up to the developer to architect any more complexity in accessing data.
