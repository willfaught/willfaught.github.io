My parents gave me a really good book of crock pot recipes for Christmas, and I thought I'd try one out Wednesday night. I went to the store for the ingredients the night before, and woke up extra early the next morning to put it together. I didn't have a proper lid for my crock pot then, but I had a heavy metal one that was the right size, so I figured it'd work just as well. When I got home from work, I was greeted by a lovely aroma, but found my dinner burned to a dry, black, simmering crisp. I had been worried about leaving the crock pot on while at work because I couldn't be home to turn it off on time, but I had hoped the juices would keep things moist like they do for other crock pot recipes. Not so. *Sigh*. Back to the drawing board.
