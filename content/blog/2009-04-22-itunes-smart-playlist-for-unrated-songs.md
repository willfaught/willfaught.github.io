title = "ITunes Smart Playlist For Unrated Songs"
+++

I had never tried to make a smart playlist in iTunes until I recently moved everything to my new iMac. I wanted to make a playlist of unrated songs, but it wasn't clear how to make a condition saying the rating must be zero stars. The iTunes help was useless, and so was everything I found online. "Just make a condition saying the rating must equal zero stars. Easy." Not so! I don't know if this changed recently, but you can't specify a rating of zero stars. I forgot about it after a half hour of searching. I took a look at it again just now and saw that you can make a condition saying the rating must be *less than* one star, which is equivalent to what I wanted. As a programmer, I feel ashamed for not seeing it sooner. Feel my shame, Apple!
