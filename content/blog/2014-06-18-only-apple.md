John Gruber:

>Apple, Google, and Microsoft each offer all three things: devices, services, and platforms. But each has a different starting point. With Apple it's the device. With Microsoft it's the platform. With Google it's the services.
>
>And thus all three companies can brag about things that only they can achieve. What Cook is arguing, and which I would say last week's WWDC exemplified more so than at any point since the original iPhone in 2007, is that there are more advantages to Apple's approach.
>
>Or, better put, there are potentially more advantages to Apple's approach, and Tim Cook seems maniacally focused on tapping into that potential.
