title: Obama Wins!
---

My apartment has a TV and cable, so I was able to watch the CNN and Daily Show coverage on Election Day. I had to watch it by myself, but I talked with Mom on the phone between McCain's concession speech and Obama's acceptance speech and talked with and texted Heather later in the night.

I was so happy that Obama won! I couldn't stop smiling. I was surprised at and pleased with how gracious McCain's speech was, although I guess it's no surprise he'd want to end on a good note, since he'll have to work with Obama as a senator. I was excited and gratified to see how Obama's election had touched so many other [parts](https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2008/11/05/world/1105-REACTS_index.html) of the [world](https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/reactions-from-around-the-world/), especially Kenya. I try not to think about and see the world as if it revolved around my country, but the world's interest in our election was undeniable. It's quite humbling when you realize how many other national elections there are around the world all the time that Americans rarely hear about, much less care about. I'm just glad it's all over.

I watched Obama's press conference on the economy today, which followed his earlier meeting with economic experts, and was again satisfied with the substance of his words, his poise, his intelligence, everything. I hope it pans out in the long run.

The [South Park episode](https://www.southparkstudios.com/episodes/207897/) about the election was pretty funny.
