title: Capitol Hill

I'd heard good things about the Capitol Hill neighborhood in Seattle as a place to live, especially for my first year here, so I decided to venture into the city to check it out. I read a little about it and decided to visit Volunteer Park first, which seems to be near the north end of the neighborhood.

The park was quite large and green and had an old water tower, a reservoir, an Asian history museum, and a conservatory. The museum closed about the time I got there, but I meandered by and into everything else. The water tower was made of mottled red and grey bricks and stands on a small knoll above a street that loops around its base. It looked like a castle turret, so I was excited to explore it. I climbed a metal staircase that wrapped around the water tank that lies inside the tower to look out from the open windows at the top level. From there, I had a wonderful view of some of the surrounding city all the way to Elliot Bay, the Sound, and the Space Needle. I didn't know until then how beautiful the sunsets here can be.

The conservatory closed shortly after I entered, but I saw several interesting plants and flowers. There were quite a few plants with leaves that had tasteful colors and patterns. It's surprising how much the humidity can change between rooms.
