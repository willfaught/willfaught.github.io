title: The Rise And Fall Of The Independent Developer
---

Rings true to me:

>And, of course, only large companies and publishers can bear these [patent and copyright infringement] costs. My fear is that It’s [sic] only a matter of time before developers find the risks and expenses prohibitive and retreat to the safety of a larger organization. We’ll be going back to square one.

>Over the years many of the top selling apps have been created by independent developers, starting with Steve Demeter and Trism at the App Store launch, and continuing to this day with titles like Tiny Wings by Andreas Illiger.

>Losing that kind of talent and innovation to a legal system is the real crime.
