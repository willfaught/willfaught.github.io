I've sometimes observed the following meanings for religious sayings:

- It's god's will: I think it's fine; I want it to happen; leave things alone.
- Amen: I agree; I'm right.

Apparently, when you have a personal thought, you can shroud it in divine invocations to make it sound more legitimate and unquestionable. It's really quite fascinating when you consider the complexity of what's being communicated and how it's being interpreted.
