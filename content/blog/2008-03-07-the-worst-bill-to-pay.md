title: The Worst Bill To Pay
---

This year is the first time I've been in charge of paying an electricity bill. Even though the bill is split four ways, I alone seem to go out of my way to turn off unused lights and electronics. I don't go so far as patrolling the halls, but sometimes I feel like you could stand outside and see where I am in the house by the windows that go dark. I didn't used to be so active about conserving energy with previous roommates, so I'm pretty sure it's just because I'm the one cutting the check for the bill. The lesson to take away here is to avoid being the one in charge of paying the electricity bill, because it's probably the most visible utility when it's used.
