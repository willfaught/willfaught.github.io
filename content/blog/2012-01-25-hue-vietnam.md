title: Hue, Vietnam
---

After Hoi An, I went to Hue. At this point, I was worried about running out of time, since I could only stay in Vietnam for thirty days. I stayed in Hue for two days. It was lightly raining the entire time, so I wore my poncho and gritted my teeth. The first day, after I checked into my hotel, I walked to the Imperial Citadel and spent all afternoon exploring the ruins (bombed by the Americans) and the buildings still standing. The second day, I hired a private motorbike guide to take me to three emperor tombs and a pagoda in the surrounding area. Bought an open tour bus ticket for Hanoi.
