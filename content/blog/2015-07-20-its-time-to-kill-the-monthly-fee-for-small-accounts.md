title: Itâ€™s Time to Kill the Monthly Fee for Small Accounts

Adam Nash:

>Unlike the many banks and brokerage firms that came before us, Wealthfront refuses to build our business by preying on clients with small accounts. It is why Wealthfront is completely free for investors with less than $10,000 invested and only a 0.25% advisory fee thereafter.
