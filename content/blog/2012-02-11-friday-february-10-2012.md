**My birthday!** Let myself sleep in. Tried to call my parents, but the wifi wasn't working. Walked into downtown and rented a bicycle for 10,000 kip. Rode around town looking at some temples. Stopped at a cafe for a Coke to cool off and use their wifi to call my parents and Tess. Continued riding around town and saw a a couple more temples. Returned the bicycle and ran into Matteo. Walked with him a little and then parted ways to go to Utopia to treat myself to a delicious dinner of steak, fries, salad, fried spring rolls, a mai tai, a mojito, and a large Beer Laos. Bernard and Jenny joined me again and we sat and drank and chatted all evening. We walked back to the hostel together, and then Bernard and I walked to the night market to buy some fruit-flavored bread for dessert. He and Jenny were leaving town the next day, but I had decided to stay an extra day. They were getting up early to see the monks collect food donations before leaving, and I thought about doing that too. We all went to bed. I had trouble falling asleep, so I decided to skip the monk stuff in the morning at sleep in instead. It's my birthday, after all.
