Honestly, I think I enjoy the titles of The Onion articles more than the actual articles. For example:

- Actress' Abortion Written Into TV Show

- High School Student Council Passes Nonbinding Resolution

- Kindergartner Being Groomed For Line-Leader Position

- Unreleased Jimmy Page Guitar Riff To Be Retrieved From Secret Vault To Save Rock And Roll

- Anchor Ad-Libs News With 97 Percent Accuracy
