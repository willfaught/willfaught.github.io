title: I Could Have Killed Windows
---

Windows has a way of getting under my skin that no other operating system can. It has a unique blend of interface freezing, printer problems, entropy, and slowdown. It drives me crazy. Actually, on the interface freezing, I've noticed that most major OS interfaces experience slow down. Is it so hard to give precedence to windows, widgets, and the mouse? Gah. I'm actually surprised more people haven't caught onto the fact that life on Mac OS is simpler. I guess people stick with what they know.
